-: One tool that you're gonna see that's different

than every company that you're probably ever work

for is gonna be called PMIS

or the project management information system.

You see, every company that you go to

they have a different quote unquote PMIS

or project management information system

that they will be using.

Now, a PMIS, if you read it the opposite, it makes sense.

It's the information system you use to manage your project.

If you read it in that way, it makes sense.

Basically it's the computer system

or it's the entirety of the entire system that you use

whether it's computer or just on pen and paper.

I'll tell you mines, to give you a good example.

When I manage a project I use Microsoft Project

for scheduling and budgeting.

I use Microsoft Word for all documents.

I use Microsoft Outlook for most communications

along with Webex to do most virtual meetings.

That's my PMIS.

It's basically the whole Microsoft Office and WebEx.

What's your PMIS?

We are a hundred percent paperless.

Maybe you guys use particular software.

Maybe you use Primavera

because you work in construction management.

Every company has a different PMIS

and this is a common tool that's not very common

but it is listed on quite a few processes.

So first of all, what is a PMIS?

What is the automated system that we're gonna use

to help the project manager optimize the schedule?

Like Microsoft Project, keep track

of all the documents and deliverables.

Use the computer system.

that a organization uses to manage a project.

We talked about this.

Every company's different.

Remember, some companies don't use Microsoft Project

'cause they use Macs and there's no MS project on a Mac.

It should include all the software

and hardware tools to be used to manage a project

from start to finish.

Now it does include what's called a work authorization

system and the configuration management system.

So what is this?

Work authorization systems is a quote unquote system,

and this is gonna be different for every business,

that you use to authorize work.

Now what that means is when a job is done

what is the procedure or the process

that someone needs to do to mark the job

as done and move on to the next thing?

Is there a procedure that you're gonna use to authorize

when Bob should start a particular task

or when Mary's done this particular task?

That's a work authorization system.

A configuration is how you manage configuration

of different deliverables or components on your project.

For example, if you're installing 10 phones

and they all need 10 different configuration

because some people don't need voicemail to email

and some people do, do you have a system for that?

There is no system that PMI is gonna tell us

or any project management book is gonna sell us.

You just have to make one up

that best meets your organization needs.

Because remember, Enterprise Environmental Factor

told us that they're different in every single business.

All right.

PMIS not something you're gonna see quite common all

over the book, but it is used

on a quite a few processes.

Just keep in mind it's something that's very unique

to a business that helps us to manage our projects.

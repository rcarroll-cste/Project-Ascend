-: In this video, I'm gonna be giving you a full introduction

to the 49 processes that we're gonna be utilizing

to manage predictive projects.

Now, this video is gonna scare the hell out of you.

Do not quit at this point.

You need to understand these processes.

Don't think of that.

You have to memorize all of them and know the in-depths

of the ITTO's of all of them,

because you don't need to know that for any exam,

whether you're taking a PMP

or a CAPM or even in real life.

But in real life and on exams

you do need to be able to identify them

in terms of understanding what they are.

So somebody says, well, you know

let's do a qualitative analysis of that.

You need to understand what that means.

Someone says, well we need to create a management plan

for this.

You need to understand what that means.

So I want you to understand things.

Don't memorize it.

It's not gonna help you on any exam

or in real life understanding is better than memorization.

Now, before I get into this and show you these 49 processes,

I wanna talk a little bit

about a history of where it came from.

In the PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition,

it outlined its 49 processes

that predictive projects generally follow.

These 49 processes are still utilized today.

Now, I know there's a PMBOK Guide Seventh Edition

we covered that already.

The PMBOK Guide seventh Edition is a very generic book.

It never gave you processes to manage a project

and particularly Hybrid, Agile, or Predictive projects.

What PMI did was they kept the PMBOK Guide Seventh Edition

very generic.

The particular methods

and processes to manage a predictive project

or Agile Projects are put into books.

PMI calls practice guides.

For example, there is an Agile practice guide,

which in the Agile section, we'll use that book.

You see, the PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition

used to have these 49 processes.

Now, when the PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition basically died,

it was replaced with a brand new book

that contains these 49 processes

that was in the PMBOK Guide six edition.

This book is called Process Group: A Practice Guide.

And here is the book.

So I have the book opened, as you guys can see.

Now, this book here, you can download this book for free

if you're a PMI member.

Or you could buy this book on Amazon.

In this section of the course

where I go through the 49 processes.

And all the processes are predictive project management.

This is the book that we get them from.

So if you wanna some kind of book to follow along

you can use this.

I do recommend my textbook, my study guide over this

because I cover it in easier format.

And again, you could purchase this from Amazon.

You don't need to because I cover it

in this course really well.

I think my study guide does a better job

of covering this book.

But there's a couple points I wanna point out.

I don't wanna show you the 49 processes here.

So this is the cover.

This is what it looks like.

You notice this book's published in 2023.

It's updated.

And I do wanna stress and emphasize this fact

that what you're seeing here

comes from the PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition.

So some people say, is the PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition dead?

No, it's not.

All the data, all of the stuff

in this book comes from the PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition.

So if you have ever studied,

read the PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition.

This will not be new.

If you've ever taken a course before that covered that book,

cover these processes, nothing new here.

But for those of us that haven't, this is all new.

So let's go back into this.

You notice the 2023 copyright data on this.

There's a couple things I wanna point out

before we get started in this study guide.

All right, there's a couple things

that I really wanna point out before we get started.

And I'm just gonna scroll past all of the table of contents.

And I'm gonna go all the way down to page one of this book

because there's something I wanna show you guys in here.

So there's a couple things here

that it says that I need you guys to know, all right?

And I'm gonna go right here.

And it says, Process Group: A Practice Guide

provides an overview

of the projects and development life cycles

in this introduction with a focus, now,

keep this in mind with a focus

on predictive life cycles throughout,

and describes the 49 processes

within the five Process Groups with their ITTOs.

ITTO stands for inputs, tools, techniques,

and outputs, ITTOs.

So once again, let's read that again

with a focus on predictive life cycles throughout,

and describe the 49 processes

within the five Process Groups.

Now I wanna emphasize this, here's why.

These 49 processes that we're gonna cover in this section,

in theory, a lot of them could be applied

to other projects such as say, Agile projects.

But we're gonna cover them

in the context of predictive project management.

But I want you as your project management knowledge evolves

and you become a better project managers

you're gonna start to see it.

You know what, Hey, this process,

I know Andrew taught it to me in a predictive way,

but I could use this in Agile.

And you're right, you could use it in Agile.

But in order to keep things simple and to follow along

with the PMI books that is recommended for your exams

we're gonna follow it

through use utilizing a predictive method.

Now the other thing here I wanna mention is notice

this practice guide identifies the processes

that are considered keyword, considered good practices

on most projects most of the time.

So these processes that we have are considered,

they're not mandatory, they're considered good practice

on most project most of the time.

So let's break that down.

So the 49 processes that we're gonna be studying

is considered good practice.

In other words, not mandatory.

People say, Andrew, I'm doing this project.

Do I have to follow this process?

No, the practice I'm giving you is good.

You should be doing them.

You don't have to do them

but they're good to do most of the time, not all the time.

So what that means is I would want you

to do all 49 processes on your project

but if this one doesn't apply to your project, don't do it.

You don't have to even do any of them.

You can do whatever you like.

The best processes for any project is the one

that produces deliverables that satisfy your customers.

And if you find none, if you don't follow any of this

and you can do that, then stick with what you're doing.

But if you are taking an exam, a PMI exam in particular

you better follow these processes.

For your exam, you will follow these processes,

you will know these processes

and you will always follow them.

That is the difference between real life and taking a test.

Now, don't discount these processes.

I want you to know them and know them not

just to pass an exam, but know them

how to apply them in real life.

I'm gonna give you guys a lot of real life examples

as I go through this.

Now go moving on.

Next thing here we wanna see is where it says,

"there is no requirement

"that any particular process or practice be performed."

All right, there's no requirement

that you have to do anything here.

It even says previous, project management should be tailored

to fit the needs of the project.

Like I told you, if you find your own way

and you got your own ways of doing things

and it's keeping your customers happy

then probably stay with it.

The ways I'm showing you are considered good practices.

They're not the only, or they're not considered mandatory.

It even says the processes should be tailored

to the specific project.

Specific methodology recommendations are outside the scope.

They don't recommend any methodology.

All they're saying is, this is what we offer

and you should follow them 'cause they're good practices.

So to recap, the processes that I'm gonna show you

in a second are good practices.

You should follow them on most projects most of the time.

But they should be tailored to match your project

in real life.

But from an exam perspective,

you don't tailor them, from an exam perspective

I want you to know them the way I teach them to you.

Though I want you to know them the way you see them

in the study guide.

I want you to know them the way you see them

in the Agile Practice Guide, I'm sorry

the Process Group: A Practice Guide.

That's how I want you to know 'em for an exam.

But if you're study, if you're doing it this in real life,

and you remember what I taught you in this course,

I would recommend you follow them.

But you don't have to.

Let's take a look at the processes now.

And the processes are gonna be on page 22, 22, 22.

Where is page 22 of the study guide?

Here it is.

Page 22.

Here it is.

Yeah, 22.

Here's all the processes that I need you guys to know.

Now, I put this in a slide presentation, all of this.

Now, I do want you to notice, initiating,

planning, executing, monitor, controlling,

and closing and their processes within them.

You can see them listed here.

Now, I put this in a slide to make it a lot easier

for you guys to understand it.

To see it on the screen, basically.

So let me open up that slide

because I made it a lot easier to show

on this screen, anyhow.

So this is what you just saw.

This is what page 22 is.

You guys can download this resource

you should have this slide deck

and you guys can see what I'm talking about.

So here are the 49 processes that you guys are gonna need

to know as we go through this.

And you notice that you have a wide variety of them.

So you have in initiating, here is my beautiful pen,

in initiating, you have two processes here.

Develop Project Charter, Identify Stakeholders.

In closing, you only have one.

In monitor and controlling, you have quite a lot.

I forgot to count on this.

I think it's two, 24, 10, 11, and one.

There's something like that.

But you can add, if you count the processes

I know 24 of these planning processes.

All of these here.

So what we're gonna be doing is

we're gonna be studying these processes

in depth as this section progresses.

All right, so you can imagine we're gonna have 49 videos

is gonna cover all these processes.

But before we get into these processes,

I wanna give you an explanations

of these five Process Groups.

And I wanna give you guys an understanding of common ITTOs.

All right, and what exactly is that?

We'll talk about that in a few minutes.

But for now, all I need you guys to know is to understand

where these processes are coming from,

that they're considered good practices.

You should be following them on your projects

although you don't have to.

And know that on your exam there's no tailoring.

Follow them, know their IT, understand their ITTOs,

and just know what they are because you know want,

these processes are gonna help you manage your project

and be a successful Project Manager.

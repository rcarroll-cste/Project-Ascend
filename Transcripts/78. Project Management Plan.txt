-: In this video,

I'm gonna be going through the project management plan.

Now, before you execute any project,

before you go out and you start digging up the dirt

on the ground to build that building, painting the wall,

typing the codes to program your application,

whatever it is you're doing, you gotta have a plan.

You gotta know how you plan to do it.

You gotta know what the hell you wanna do

in the first place.

You gotta know what you wanna do,

how much you're gonna spend,

how long on all the methods of getting the work done.

This is all gonna be stored in a pretty big document

called a project management plan.

Now, what exactly is this project management plan?

Well, this project management plan is a document

that defines how the project is executed.

So first thing up I wanna talk about is this word "how."

So when you say how to do something,

you're basically gonna be giving someone the steps

on how to execute that task.

So the document is how.

It's a pretty big document

because it's just not saying

what you're doing, how much, and how long.

It's also giving the steps on how to manage quality,

how to manage people, how to manage your vendors,

how to manage risk, and many other things.

So it defines how the project is executed.

That means getting the work done,

how you're gonna monitor it, control it,

and how you're gonna close it.

It has 18 components, 14 plans, and four baselines.

We'll take a look

at what those 18 components are in a minute.

As we go through the 49 processes,

and you go through your...

If you're reading, you have the study guides,

PMI study guides in particular,

you're gonna see them use the word

"included but not limited to."

A lot of times they say input to a process

and then they'll say project management plan.

And then they'll say,

"Well, you can use this plan and this plan and this plan,

but included but not limited to."

What that means is a catchall term.

What that means is, hey, you can use all these things

but you can also use all these other things.

So they're not limited to just that.

Now, the PM plan itself, I do wanna show you guys this.

It does have quite a lot.

Oops, this thing is way off center. Here we go.

It does have quite a lot of components

and I want you guys to see the components

in this darker blue section right here.

You see all of these right here?

All of these here are the 18 components,

starting with the scope management plan,

the requirements management plan,

to schedule management plan.

All of these things here

are the project management plan components.

Now, some of them are not difficult to understand

and some of them contains pretty difficult stuff.

These are the processes.

You see these processes?

As I get to these processes, as I'm doing these processes,

when we start covering the 49 processes,

I'm gonna be explaining to you

what all these components are.

Now, you're probably saying to yourself,

"Wow, that's a lot of stuff in a project management plan.

Does all projects have that?"

A lot of projects may not have

all of these 18 components, all right?

Very rarely that they would have all 18 components.

Written, in particular.

A lot of us have it.

We just have it in our heads.

And I'm gonna explain more of that as this course progresses

and I go through the 49 processes with you.

But for now, I want you to know that, hey,

this project management plan is gonna be an input

into almost every single one of those 49 processes.

Basically, it's this big document

that tells you how you're gonna execute,

how you're gonna monitor, how you're gonna control.

Even tells you basically how to plan too.

So it's a document.

Think about this.

If this plan tells you how to do something,

it would be an input to that process.

So that's what I need you guys to know.

Now, as I go through the actual course,

as I start to cover the processes,

we're gonna be learning in depth

about each of those 18 components.

-: In this video, I'm gonna be giving you an introduction

to traditional project management

and what's coming in this part of the class.

Now, as far as we can go back in time

and we have been building as humans have gotten a brain

and we have learned to build things

whether it's building some kind of chair to sit on

or building a big monument or skyscraper or something.

We have been using traditional project management methods.

In fact, 99% of the time

when people say I do project management

the problem is they really work in like software development

or computer-based stuff.

They're probably following traditional project management.

Now, traditional project management

goes by a variety of names.

You may hear it being called waterfall methods.

In the world of software development,

waterfall was their version

of traditional project management.

Some people call it predictive project management.

Why predictive?

Because the scope is known and you have done things before.

You see, when you have done something before

or you have done things many times

you can basically predict how to do it

and how to do it correctly again.

For example, you went to the gym and you exercise.

If I told you go to the gym tomorrow and exercise

you're probably gonna predict how you're gonna do it

because you've done it before.

So traditional project management

goes by a variety of names.

Predictive, traditional, or waterfall.

Anytime you hear that on any exam question

or any time you go manage a project

that's what they're talking about,

traditional project management.

So in this section, I really wanna go over this.

Now traditional project management has a wide variety

of processes that PMI wants us to know.

These 49 processes

that we're gonna be covering this section,

it does have a variety of different documents

that I need you guys to know

and a variety of different plans

that I also need you guys to know.

So this is gonna be a pretty big section.

Now, traditional project management

is more complex to learn than agile.

Agile is much more easier to learn

and you'll see that when I get to the agile section.

Now, let's take a look at traditional project management.

Okay.

So, traditional project management also called waterfall.

Again, it's also called predictive

is better when the customer needs a well-defined

standards to follow are clear and changes are not expected.

Let's break down all of this.

So on a traditional project,

the first thing that we say

is the customer needs a well-defined,

you see on an agile project,

now the customer needs, this is called the scope

the work that needs to get done.

On an agile project the scope evolves over time.

The customer starts out at a very high level scope.

They say, well, I want an accounting software

but they're not too sure what features they want.

And the team starts to build a very conceptual thing

or a very unusable thing, something that can't be used

but gives the customer enough to see what's there.

And then the customer keeps adding

till they get something usable.

On a traditional project that's not like that.

On a traditional project

the customer needs has to be well-defined

from the very, very start.

For example, building a 20 story building.

If you have to build a 20 story building

you better best bet that you have to define everything

before you break the ground and start drilling the holes

into the concrete to build your building.

You can't build a foundation

and then determine how many stories.

You have to know how many stories, what's in those stories,

how high the ceilings are,

before you dig the foundation, right?

So, in other words

we have to understand that in a traditional project

the scope is known at the very beginning.

The scope has to be well defined

and clear at the very beginning,

standards to follow are clear.

So this is important.

All right?

Standards to follow has to be very clear.

Now, you see one of the names

that's given to traditional project

is called predictive project management.

Predictive project management means that they can predict

how the project will be managed, controlled or executed,

monitor, controlled, and closed.

Because you know what?

They've probably done it a lot of times.

Building a building is something the processes they follow

to build a foundation, build the first floor,

the second floor are things that have been done many times.

The standards to do that is perfectly clear.

It's not something that they're going to define

as time is moving on.

So the standards to build buildings

or standards or the processes we follow

on a traditional projects are well-defined.

We know them because we have done them a lot

and we know they're gonna be successful.

And changes are not expected.

You see, when a project executes

and the team starts to build those deliverables,

is it okay to get changes?

In a lot of circumstances, sure

but in certain traditional projects, no.

You see, let's say you're building a 20 story building.

The team has built 15 stores.

The customer comes and says, we don't want 20 anymore,

we want 30.

You think the team can add 15 more

to that original plan that said 20?

No, because now the weight,

let's say the foundation

and the structure underneath it

was being built to support 20.

Now they're gonna put 10 more on top of that,

the whole thing will collapse.

So they're not expecting any changes.

In fact, they add 10 more stories,

we have to demolish everything,

then restart the work again.

You think about this, only software project,

if the team bills an invoicing system, right?

An invoicing software,

and the customer don't like the way it's laid out,

they don't like the way payments are accepted,

the team can just go in and modify it.

So, on an agile project,

it's okay for changes and changes are welcome

and changes are expected.

But on a traditional, remember,

traditional projects changes are not expected

and changes has to be managed and controlled.

You have to come up with a way to manage changes.

If not you're gonna end up with something

called scope creep, which is in which case

the scope just grows and grows and grows out of control.

And before you know it you have a monster.

Project managers in control, not the team

and on an agile project the team generally stays in control.

Planning, all planning is done upfront.

So, one of the things that really differentiate

agile projects from traditional projects,

traditional projects, all the planning is done upfront.

So we could spend a year or two planning.

And when the project executes,

the objective is to stay on plan,

no variation from the plan.

And if there is, we gotta bring it back to plan.

So, all the planning is done upfront

versus throughout the entire project.

The other thing here is that,

by the way on an agile project,

planning is done throughout the project

as the product is building increments.

Objective is to complete the set scope

in as little time as possible and reduce cost.

So on a traditional project,

your objective is to build that 20 story building

with a set time of two years

and within your $100 million budget.

Our objective is, can we finish this quicker

and can we not spend that a hundred dollars?

If you bring in your project ahead of schedule

and on the budget, great,

but if you go over schedule or you go way over budget,

people are gonna be upset.

Okay.

This is what a traditional project is.

Now, I do wanna stress to you guys

the traditional project management

does have a lot of processes,

it does have a lot of documents, and a lot of plans,

that you're gonna wanna know

whether you're taking a PMP exam,

or you're taking a CAPM exam,

or any of the PMI exam.

Because in this section,

we're gonna be taking a look at all of these processes

that you're gonna need to know for your exam.

Now, you don't need to go memorizing all of them.

You don't need to memorize all their quote unquote ITTOs

that are associated with them,

but you should at least understand them,

understand the tools, the techniques, understand the inputs,

and the outputs, don't memorize any of this stuff.

Go through the videos, make sure you understand them.

That way, if you ever take one of these exams

you're gonna be okay.

And if ever, more importantly,

if you encounter them in real life,

you're also gonna be okay.

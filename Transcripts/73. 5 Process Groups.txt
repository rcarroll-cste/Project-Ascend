-: In this video, we're gonna be talking

about the five process groups, and particularly,

what are you doing in each of those process groups.

I want you guys to be able

to anytime you hear the word initiate, think authorization.

If you hear the word plan, think the PM plan.

Anytime you guys hear the word execute and think of work.

Monitor control and think of keeping stuff on track

and closing to shut it down.

I want you guys to be able to understand these concepts

and I want you guys to be able to understand

how these process groups will flow,

what is the order of them flowing,

in order to complete a deliverable

or complete a phase of a project?

So let's go ahead and get started.

So the first thing up I wanna talk about

is gonna be these five process groups

that I have listed here

and I wanna give you more of a written definition on them

than just me telling you.

So the first thing up we wanna talk about

is anytime you guys hear the word initiated.

Now, if you remember from the process group chart,

initiated has basically two processes

of defined stakeholders,

create project charter and define stakeholders.

So what are you doing here?

Well, this is gonna be done to define a project.

Oops, where's my pen?

Define a project or phase of an existing project.

So we're defining a project,

we're creating a brand new project.

Now keep in mind, these 49 processes

is also used in every phase of your project.

So it's used to define a project

or phase of an existing project,

and it's done to authorize the start of the project

and assign the project manager.

So if you're taking any exam,

whether you're doing a CAPM or a PMP or in real life,

remember something, in initiating,

you're gonna be authorizing

the start of the project or the phase,

and you're gonna be assigning the project manager

for that phase or that project at that time.

So anytime you guys think of initiating,

think of authorizing the work to get started,

authorizing the project manager,

giving the project manager the authority

he or she needs to do the work.

Next thing up we have is planning.

This is gonna be done to establish the scope of the project,

define the course of action required

to obtain the objectives.

So in planning, we are going to establish the main scope.

Now, in initiating, we generally get a high level scope.

It's not a very detailed scope, but in planning,

you're gonna get this much more elaborated scope

and you want your scope to be as detailed as possible.

I'll cover that when I get to scope management.

You are also gonna define the course of action.

So what do they mean by that?

Course of action basically means the step needed

in order to build that scope.

What are the steps?

What is the work needed to paint the room?

For example, if your scope is to paint this room,

what is the course of action needed to paint the room?

Well, you have to buy the paint, remove the furniture,

tape up the wall, prime the wall, paint the wall,

put the furniture back.

So in planning, you're just not defining what the scope is,

but you're defining all the actions you're gonna need

to obtain that particular scope.

That's gonna be including setting the budget,

setting the schedule.

It's gonna be defining the different kinds of risk

or identifying the risk, defining quality requirements,

defining how you plan to staff and manage the project.

So many things goes into planning.

In fact, if you remember from your chart table,

if you remember that there were

quite a lot of processes in planning.

When it comes to executing,

I want you guys to think of work.

So this is done to complete the work.

It should be K there. Sorry about that.

Complete the work defined in the project management plan.

So the project management plan

is what you're gonna get out of planning.

When you finish planning, you're gonna have a PM plan.

This plan tells you the scope,

it tells you the schedule, it tells you the budget,

and it tells you how to obtain the scope.

It tells you all the actions you need to obtain this scope.

In executing, what you're gonna be doing

is you're going to be actually completing

whatever the plan says.

If the plan says remove the furniture,

then remove the furniture.

If the plan says to paint the wall white,

then paint the wall white.

Anytime you guys think of executing,

I want you guys to think of actually doing the work.

The next thing you have is monitoring and controlling.

Done to track, review, and regulate the progress

and performance of the project.

Monitoring and controlling is something that you

as a project manager is gonna be doing extensively.

You have to monitor and control the work.

You have to make sure that the project stays on plan.

How do you monitor control?

Well, you take a look at your plan.

The plan says you're supposed to paint

this wall white today.

You're supposed to spend $100.

So that's your scope, your scheduling, your budget.

And then when the painter starts painting,

you go and you watch, are they painting that wall white?

Are they doing it according to the budget?

Are they doing it according to the schedule?

That's monitoring and controlling.

It's about tracking the work,

reviewing the work and regulating.

So tracking is checking to see

if the work actually matches up.

Reviewing the work that was done, inspecting the work,

and then regulating it, letting them know

whether they're doing it right or wrong.

Looks for any areas in which changes to the plan

are required and initiate the changes.

So another thing you're doing here is you're looking to see

if there's any variance on the plan,

or does the plan need to be changed?

Sometimes you may not have budgeted enough money,

sometimes you may not have budgeted enough time

or have the right scope in there.

So monitor and control, and what that's gonna do

is you can initiate the changes there

in order to update your plan.

The next thing I have is closing.

This is gonna be done to formally complete

or close the project phase or contract.

Closing comes at the end.

The deliverable is done, the customer has accepted it.

You have to formally shut down your project when it's done.

You have to release your resources.

Do your final lesson learned.

Make a document called a project report,

a final report saying what was successful, what was not.

So when you're taking a look at your five process groups,

now as this course progressed,

we're gonna go into these five process groups

and we are gonna be covering every single one

of the 49 processes that falls within these process groups

more in depth, but this is just a good look at them.

Now, the other thing here I wanna talk about

is how these process groups works together.

So I have a diagram.

We're gonna concentrate on the center of this diagram

because I wanna show you how it flows together in this.

So let's take a look at this diagram that I have here.

Now, I don't want you guys to worry too much

about project boundaries.

I want you guys to look at the center of this diagram.

So this comes from page 70 of the PMI Process Group

or Practice Guides book.

So I want you guys to look at this.

This is the part here I want you guys to watch.

You see this, you initiate a project.

Once the project has been authorized,

then you start planning it.

You do all those 24 planning processes, then you execute it.

Now, you notice how there's like a circle right here.

Why is that?

Because sometime you plan to do work,

then you go do the work,

then you come back to plan to do the next set of work.

Sometimes you can't plan all the work upfront,

although you may try to.

But what this is showing you is you plan,

you execute the work, you go back to planning if needed,

then you go to close it.

But what happened with monitoring and controlling?

Well, monitoring and controlling sits at the very top

because monitoring and controlling

allows you to monitor and control the planning.

Monitoring and controlling executing.

Monitoring and controlling the closing.

Monitoring and controlling the initiating.

Anytime you're in any part of these process groups,

you always monitor and control the work,

making sure the work stays on plan,

making sure the work is regulated correctly.

So this is how these things will flow.

Okay, hopefully this video gives you a good understanding

of what these process groups are

because as I start getting into the processes,

especially with 49 processes,

you can wanna know exactly where they fall into.

The other thing else we wanna know is those ITTOs,

which we'll be getting to soon.

So make sure you understand what these process groups are

and what exactly you're doing in them.

-: One tool that you can use

throughout your entire 49 processes

or managing your entire project

is good interpersonal and team skills.

Now, this is a tool and a technique.

There are different kinds of techniques

that we're gonna be using

throughout our project to manage our people.

A great project manager has amazing people skill.

Now, this course is not designed for this.

This course is not designed to tell you

how to become an amazing people person.

But I'll give you guys a word of advice.

When you finish this course,

you finish your whatever certification exam you're taking,

you're doing a PMP, you're doing a CAPM,

PRINCE2, whatever certification you wanna do

and you're going out there and you're saying to yourself,

"Well, I need more education,

I wanna become a better project manager."

Here's what I want you guys to say.

I want you guys to say,

"Well, I'm gonna become a better people person.

Because that's what this is all about."

Becoming better people person and managing people is the key

to becoming an amazing project manager.

And that's what this tool is.

Interpersonal and team skills.

We need to have good interpersonal skills,

what we call soft skills.

Let's go through it.

All project managers need to have good,

where is that pen?

I had it upside down.

All project manager needs to have good interpersonal

and team skills to manage different stakeholders.

It's the most important real-life

project management tool we have here.

I'm gonna tell you guys,

no tool is more important than this.

You can't manage people, you cannot manage project, period.

What are some methods?

Well, one of the things is call active listening.

This is understanding, acknowledging,

and clarifying what others are saying.

Active listening, are you actively listening

to me right now?

As I'm talking, are you trying to ask questions you see

and how to apply to you understanding it?

When someone comes up to you, especially a team member

and they say something like,

"I'm having this issue on a project."

Are you clarifying for question?

Are you actually comprehending what they're saying?

Or is your mind just wandering?

Another big interpersonal skill

that I will cover a lot when I get to the processes

that deals with managing people

is called conflict management.

Now, on the PMP exam in particular,

there is tons of question on conflict management.

Upwards of 25% of that exam,

what we have, a fight between Bob and Peter,

they're disagreeing on how to install the server.

What should the project manager do?

That's an actual PMP question by the way.

Anytime you bring a team member together,

they're gonna have conflict.

Anytime you have a group of people together,

they're gonna have a conflict.

You need to deescalate the conflict and solve the conflict,

find the root cause of the conflict

for the benefit of the project.

Facilitation, projects are not just generally done

by one person.

Projects are done by a group of people.

Facilitation is the art of managing a group.

It includes bringing the group together,

generating ideas, solving problems,

and making sure that the team

is this person managed correctly.

You see, facilitation is the key

to managing people sitting around, talking,

getting ideas done, getting work done.

A lot of times, if this isn't done correctly,

you better best bet

that people are gonna start creating conflict.

If you do correct facilitation, that wouldn't happen.

One of the other things that I see a lot of people doing is,

wasting time in meetings.

Do you waste time in meetings?

Do you have good meeting management techniques?

How many of you guys, right now, spend more time

in meetings than actually getting work done?

Maybe today you spend two hours in a meeting,

but you only spend an hour doing work

because that two-hour meeting was a waste of time.

We don't, meetings can be highly productive

and not a waste of time,

or they can be an incredible waste of time.

So meetings, in order for them to be done correctly,

must have an agenda.

What are we gonna be covering?

Inviting the right stakeholders.

If you ever go in a meeting

and you said nothing and no one said anything to you,

probably you didn't belong there.

Unless you have a real input to that meeting

and your opinion actually matters, you should go.

If not, don't go.

If decisions are made by particular people and not by you,

your best bet is to just go do your work

and hear the decision later.

One of the things I can't stand up at meetings

is people not putting the time limit.

The meeting should be set for an hour or maybe half an hour.

After that, the meeting ends.

Get into the habit of doing that.

Don't get into the habit of extended meetings.

If you extend meetings for,

we're supposed to be 30 minutes,

but then we end up spending an hour, that's not good.

Then people get in the habit of not shutting up,

not getting to the point.

I need them to get to the point so the meeting can move on.

Remember something, if a painter is in a meeting,

what is he or she not doing?

That's right, they're not painting a wall.

If a programmer is in a meeting,

what's the programmer not doing?

Delivering value to the customer.

The customer only sees value on working software.

If a programmer is talking

and having a meeting with another programmer

and they're not coding, then you know what?

They're not producing value.

Now, we're not saying not to have meetings.

We just want our meetings to be productive.

So we want to set that limit.

Follow up with meeting minutes and action items

so people know what to do.

Humans have this thing, we call selective memory.

And if you've worked long enough,

you'll know what that's about.

People like remembering what they wanna remember.

The best thing to do is send out action items when done.

Action items gives everyone a reminder,

meeting minutes gives everyone a reminder what was covered

and action items, what needs to get done.

Okay, these are some great interpersonal skills.

This is gonna be one of the most common tools

you're gonna see across the 49 processes

'cause if you think about it,

if you're not good at this particular one,

interpersonal and team skills,

you're not gonna manage projects good.

So make sure that you are really good

and you're the best at managing people.

 -: In this long video, I'm gonna be going through

four common tools that you're gonna see listed

way across the processes,

and that's the tool dealing with data,

in particularly get data gathering,

how are we gonna do that?

Data analysis, data representation, and decision making.

You see think about this,

as you're managing a project,

as you're planning a project,

as you're managing the execution

or modern control in a closing of it,

you're gonna acquire a lot of data.

You're gonna get data,

you're gonna look at data such as

how long is a particular task taken?

How is the schedule being made?

How many issues do we have?

How many risk are there?

As you go through your project,

you guys are gonna acquire a lot of data,

and that data's gonna help you make particular decisions.

For example, do we need a change request

to extend the schedule or do we need to go

and request additional funding from our managers?

In order to do that, you would need to acquire data

on what's happening on a project and then maybe forecast it

or analyze that data to forecast it to see,

hey, do we need more money later, or maybe not.

This brings me to the four tools.

Now, I want you guys to take a look at this.

There are four particular tools that I wanna go over.

Data gathering.

As you go through the project

you're gonna be gathering information on what's happening

at the current state of the project and previous.

Data analysis, as you gather data

you're gonna analyze the data that was gathered.

Is there any trend or variances

that are forming in the data?

And then come representation.

When you analyze the data,

you wanna represent the data in charts and graph,

so we can then make a decision on what to do with the data.

So generally we're gonna gather the data,

we're gonna analyze data, we're gonna represent the data,

and then we're gonna make a decision on the data.

That's generally what we're doing here.

Now, I wanna go into in-depth into these sections.

Before this though, I'll give you a quick example.

Let's say you're managing a project.

One of the components of managing a project

is you're gonna be managing the schedule of the project.

So what you need to do is you need to go out,

let's say you're painting a room

and they're finished painting half of it.

Well, you're gonna have to go out

and you're gonna have to gain data

on how much of the room they finished painting.

So, you go out and you gather how much room

they finished painting.

You analyze the data you gather,

well they finished painting these two walls.

You analyze that and you compare it against the plan.

You can then present this data

maybe in charts and graphs to show the progression

of how they're staying on schedule or not

and they make a decision.

Do we add more time to the project?

Do we reduce time to it because they're painting faster?

So that'll be decision making.

Or are we just doing great?

Maybe we don't do anything.

So that's the decision.

Doing nothing is a choice.

Okay.

So, these are gonna be the four tools.

Let's go more in depth

into these four tools that I have here.

So, the first thing up is going to be data gathering.

This is the big one.

Data gathering,

as you work through any particular process

you better expect that you're gonna be gathering

lots and lots of information as time is progressing.

Now, some common methods to gathering data

is what I have here.

The first way to gather data,

maybe you're working on a team

and you're trying to see

whether what we're doing is correct.

The one of the best ways to do that is

to brainstorm it, man.

This is when you bring together a group of stakeholders

to get ideas and analyze them.

They're generally facilitated by you.

So brainstorming session, you bring everyone in

and you try to ask them for ideas.

You say, hey, what do you think is happening is good?

Or how long did you spend on doing this?

Another thing similar to this is interviewing people.

One of this is gathering data.

You know, you go out and you wanna gather requirements

for a particular projects requirement gathering

is a big thing.

If your requirements are not gathered correctly,

your project will fail.

The more accurate the requirement,

the more likely your projects are gonna be successful.

So, one of the best thing is to interview them,

interview stakeholders.

Anytime I'm gonna gather data,

the best way is just to interview them.

This is just going about asking them a series of questions

about their thoughts and views of what's happening.

Focus group is when you bring together

subject matter experts to understand their perspective,

sometimes it's best to interview people that has

in-depth knowledge of that particular project

you're building or proven or change it.

A checklist.

Let's say I'm installing a phone system

and for you as a project manager,

and what features would you like?

Would you like voicemail to email?

Would you like a video phone?

Would you like a soft phone?

Would you like call conferencing?

Maybe I can give you a whole checklist of all the features

and then you're gonna say to me,

"Hey Andrew I like this and I like this and I like this."

This is good to do.

So this would be a checklist.

This is generally created by the organization

given to the stakeholders for them to identify

what they may want on a particular project

and things that they may not want.

Maybe they'll put an x and put a check what they want

or x on things they don't want.

You may have success criteria, acceptance criteria

which I'll cover later might be here too.

The other thing I have is questionnaires and surveys.

Now, questionnaires and surveys can be given out

to all stakeholders to understand

how they feel about something.

One of the most common things you find nowadays

is any place you call, they say, would you take a survey?

One of the things we can find out

about stakeholder satisfaction on a project

whether it's a performance or the output of a project

is by asking them questions.

That's gonna be a survey.

So, this is gathering data.

Once you have acquired data, what are you gonna do?

Well, once you have done that,

you have to analyze the data,

to analyze the data we're gonna be using a few methods,

and these are gonna be some common methods

that you're gonna find.

First thing up is alternative analysis.

Alternative analysis looks at different options

or ways to accomplish something.

Let's say there is a problem on the project

and you found the root cause of the problem,

the main cause of the problem.

How do you solve that problem?

Is there one way to do it or is there five different ways?

The best way is to look at all the different options.

That's alternative analysis.

Just don't look at one option.

Look at many options.

Anytime you gather data and it's related to issues

on the project, such as the project is being delayed,

the project is spending too much money,

it's not accomplishing the scope.

Ask yourself the real reason why.

For example, your team is working

and you realize that the project is getting slower.

They're not coding as fast as they could.

So your thing is, ideally it seems like

they're just slacking off, right?

They're just, maybe they're spending too much time

on the internet, not enough time coding.

That's what it seems like, right?

So, but after you analyze the problem,

you spoke with the team members,

you talk to them,

you get to the main cause.

You came to find out that they're not familiar

with that particular programming language.

That's why they were spending a lot of times

on the internet and they weren't doing their job.

Why? Because they were trying to learn it.

That's a root cause analysis,

looking for the main underlying problem

for particular event.

Another thing I want you guys to know

something call variance and trend.

Know the difference between these two.

A variance is how far you're off from something.

A trend is where you're going with this.

So a variance is used to find

the exact difference between things.

So how far are you off?

What's the difference between here and here?

So, a variance is this.

As of Wednesday last week you were supposed to be done

60% of the work.

You finish 50% of the work.

So what's the variance?

10% of the work not being complete.

If as of Wednesday last week you were supposed to spend $200

but you spend $220, the variance is a $20 difference.

In other words, but you're over budget by $20.

Now, is this good or bad?

You see, variance tells something on that particular day.

But is it getting worse or better?

Well, that's a trend.

Trend involve looking at data over a period of time

to see if a trend is forming.

What if on Wednesday you were 10% off,

on Tuesday, on of the schedule,

you're 10% behind schedule.

On Wednesday you're 15, Thursday you're 20.

This is the trend now.

You're trending negative,

you're trending way behind schedule.

So this is not good.

Now, you have to step in and fix it.

Maybe there's a couple of variances here and there,

it's fine,

but if you're able to come back on schedule, you're okay.

But if the trend is showing that you're going way off

probably gotta keep an eye on that.

Once you have gathered data, you have analyzed the data,

what are you gonna do?

The next thing here is gonna be to present the data.

All right?

Different charts and graph.

Different ways to show people the data.

So, different ways the data could be shown to stakeholders

particularly maybe something like a flow chart show.

Show the stakeholders.

This is the process we follow to fix a project

or complete a particular activity.

All types of charts,

matrixes.

That's gonna be more like a table.

Fishbone diagram.

Histograms are gonna be like bar chart.

Fishbone diagrams allows me,

we're gonna cover these particular things

coming up in quality processes.

That's gonna show me how to find problems.

So, present the data to your customer.

Data representation is a way to present data to the customer

in a way that they can understand the data.

Once a customer is seeing the data,

the next thing now is to make a decision, right?

We make decisions based on the data we got.

All projects do this.

Based on the data that we got,

the decision was made.

The better that data, the better your decision making.

So you wanna acquire your data good, right?

You wanna gather the data correctly and analyze the data.

What are some ways teams make decisions?

Number one, voted.

So, they go around the room

and they vote on a particular thing.

You can have voting where the majority wins,

you also have ones where everyone agree.

You also plurality, mispronounce that word,

where majority is not obtained,

but a decision is still chosen.

You also have autocratic decision making.

This is when one person make a decision for the entire team.

Maybe they trust that particular person.

Another way to make decision

is gonna be multicriteria decision analysis.

This is when you make a table

that lists different types of criteria

and then evaluate them.

So for example, when you choose a painter, the painter room

what exactly are the criteria

are you using to choose a painter?

Are you using cost, experience, certification, licenses,

availability, location, reviews?

Maybe all of that?

What are the main criteria you're gonna be using?

Some people may just look at price and availability.

Some people might look, well, is he available?

Is this person located in our town?

Maybe, maybe not.

Different projects, we use different criteria,

but a lot of times when we make a decision

on selecting something or doing a particular task,

it's not gonna be based on a single criteria.

More than likely we based on multiple criterias.

Okay.

Nice long video.

We covered a lot of tools here.

You're gonna find these tools used quite a lot.

Now there's more to these tools.

What I'm showing you here, the most common ones.

But as I go through the 49 processes,

they're gonna be more to these particular tools,

particular things that I have not covered.

But remember by the time I finished all the 49,

I would've covered all of them.

So make sure to review this video

and understand what these particular tools are.

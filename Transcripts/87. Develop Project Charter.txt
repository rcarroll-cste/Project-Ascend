-: In this video, I'm gonna be starting up

the 49 processes that we need to know

to manage our predictive projects.

So one of the things that I wanna review with you guys

before we get started is I wanna just take a quick look

at that 49 process chart to show you where we are.

Because here, we are gonna start

with the initiating section of a project.

So if you remember what initiating is,

initiating is all about getting approval.

It's about getting the project approved.

When you think of initiating, think of project approval.

So we're gonna be covering two processes listed here.

So I want you guys to take a look at this.

So here I have the two processes in initiating.

We're gonna be doing Develop Project Charter

which is what I'm gonna cover in this video.

And the next one, we'll take

a look at Identify Stakeholders,

so that's what we're doing here.

We're gonna be basically covering the processes

in initiating, and then we'll jump over to planning.

We'll cover all these planning processes

that you guys see listed here in depth one at a time.

Then we'll take a look at executing monitor and control,

and closing for the total of the 49 processes.

Now, one of the things that I told you guys earlier

is we're not gonna cover

all the process's ITTO's,

Inputs, Tools, Techniques, and Output.

We're gonna be covering the main inputs,

the main tools, the main outputs.

When they're common inputs

or common tools, or common outputs,

I'm not gonna cover that

because they basically stay the same.

For example, when we use expert judgment,

if you use expert judgment,

which is hiring a subject matter expert

to do something for you,

whether you're doing develop schedule,

develop project charter that we're gonna be doing now,

it doesn't matter what the process is.

If the tool is expert judgment, it stays the same.

Just using an expert to help you get this process done.

Okay. So with that, let's get started

with the first of the 49 processes.

And that's gonna be one of the first things

you're gonna do when you actually get a project

is to get it authorized, is to have approval

from management to actually do that project.

You can't consume organizational resources,

such as the money that they bring in their HR resources,

like people's time, like getting an engineer,

getting a software developer

to come and work on your project.

You can't consume the organization resources

if you don't have permission from that business.

So let's get started on this one.

So the first thing up I have is gonna be

Develop Project Charter.

Now develop project charter is the first process.

What is this process?

Well, this is the process that, notice what it says,

of developing a document to formally authorize

a project or a phase.

Remember, the project charter is gonna formally authorize

that project or that phase.

Now, this document, again, is gonna be this project charter.

It's gonna outline the project objectives,

basically, what this project will get done.

It could say things like, paint this room

or build this building, or develop this application.

Another thing that the charter does

is that it's gonna defies the authority

for the project manager.

Okay. It's gonna say that this person, Bob,

is gonna be in charge of this project.

Mary's in charge of this project.

Here's the authority that they're gonna have.

It provides the project manager

with authority to put resources together.

Remember, to consume resources on a project,

you actually need approval.

You just can't go and spend money in our organization

if you don't have approval from management.

The approved charter formally initiates a project.

Remember, if the charter is approved,

the project is officially started.

Now, here are the ITTOs that are associated

with developing the charter.

Now, a lot of these things here,

things like the organizational process assets,

all of these tools will be covered.

Expert judgment, data gathering,

interpersonal and team skills meetings, we covered.

So what I told you guys

is when I covered these 49 processes,

the common ones we're not gonna cover

'cause we already covered that.

Just rewatch the videos that I covered

these things in, right?

These like, expert judgment, data gathering, and so on.

But what we are gonna cover are the important,

the ITTOs, the inputs, tools, and techniques

that's unique to this process.

Such as what?

Well, business documents and agreements.

That's unique here, so let's cover those.

And of course, I wanna talk about

the charter and something we all should have

on a project called an assumption log.

So unique inputs here we have

is something we call business documents.

What exactly is that?

Well, business documents.

It's gonna contain specific information

on why we should do this project,

like why should it be initiated?

Think about this.

You want to consume organizational resources

to do your project.

The question is, why should they give you money?

What makes your project so important?

In every business you work for,

there're gonna be multiple projects

that are trying to be initiated.

There's gonna be multiple projects that wants to get done.

Why should the organization select yours?

Can you prove the business case?

Are you returning more value than other projects?

There are two main business-case documents, all right?

Number one is just the business case itself.

This is necessary information to determine

whether or not the project is worth the investment.

And things you can look at are gonna be things

like market demand, customer requests, legal requirement.

For example, a good business case

could be we need to initiate this project

because there's a brand new regulation

that our product needs to implement

more safety equipment in it.

So you have to modify your current product

in order to keep it on the market.

That'd be a great business case.

Another good business case could be, well,

there's been an enormous amount of customer requests

for us to add this feature to our current product

or for us to add this particular product to our portfolio.

There's been a big request in my company

for people asking me,

"Andrew, can you create a risk management course?"

As I'm recording this, I'm actually writing a syllabus

for it because there's just a lot of requests

for it, so we started a project on it.

One thing I do want you guys to understand

is what exactly is called a benefits management plan?

Now, the benefit management plan is a document

that they write, that basically, listen carefully,

it'll measure the benefits of the output of the project.

You see, when the project is done,

what benefit will the company get?

So definition, describes the main benefit

the project would produce once it's complete

and how you will measure it.

Now, it could be created by doing

a cost-benefit analysis of a project.

So say this to yourself.

When this project is done,

what is the main benefit that they're gonna get out of it?

Is it gonna increase revenue by 20%?

That's something you can write

in your benefits management plan

because you're gonna measure the benefit in terms

of revenue and percentages, and you're hoping for 20%.

Is it gonna increase the market share

of your products by 10%?

That's another benefit we can write in this particular plan.

So you have to come up,

you have to document the main benefits

of doing this project.

No organization wants to spend money

or give you money to do a project

if they don't understand the benefit

or the main objective of, or money,

I would think more than likely,

that they're gonna be getting.

Is it gonna increase customer satisfaction?

You gotta document that.

Another input that we saw was something called agreement.

Agreements is a contract.

Now, you gotta understand why this is an input

and how it works here.

So if you work as a contractor,

and you get a contract or an agreement

with a customer, that initiates a project for you.

For example, let's say, you are a construction contractor,

and I wanna renovate my kitchen.

So I hire you to renovate my kitchen,

and I make a contract with you, that,

hey, I want you to renovate the kitchen.

I want you to change all the cupboards

and put a new sink in, and change the tile.

That's my kitchen renovation.

I sign a contract for you to do it.

Now, you have to understand how this works

because that contract is actually gonna become an input

to your project charter because now, you have

to start up an entire project to renovate my kitchen.

That's why this thing is an input here.

So an agreement can have things

like a service level agreement

in which case, service level agreements are done

for when you have to provide a certain service

and a certain level that it has to be maintained.

For example, an ISP or an internet service provider

would give you a contract to maintain internet

at 99% availability.

It could be a letter of intent.

In other words, we intend to get this job done.

It's generally a contract

between an internal, external customer.

Contracts are always gonna be between somebody internal

to the business and somebody external to the business.

Work required to be performed for payment.

Nobody, you don't wanna pay someone until you get

a contract with them and you actually start to work,

so that's what that's saying.

The output is what I wanna talk about.

The output is the project charter.

Now for your exam, you have to remember what a charter does.

A charter formally authorizes the existence

of the project, all right?

That means the project is official.

If senior management or senior stakeholders

like your sponsor signs off on your contract,

on your charter, your golden, your project is approved.

It assigns the project manager in the authority level.

Signed by senior management can include things

like your sponsor.

It'll have high-level requirements,

high-level risks, preliminary budget, preliminary schedule.

Now, everything in a project charter,

you have to remember is high-level.

The project charter does not contain things

that are very detailed.

In fact, everything is high-level.

The project charter is gonna say,

oh, we're gonna paint this room.

But it doesn't actually go into say,

this specific like one coat of primer

and two coats of regular paint.

It doesn't go into it.

It just say paint the room, repaint the room.

It might not even specify the color.

It'll say develop a counter application,

but it wouldn't say what module

or particular features it'll have.

Why? Because it's very high level.

It's something they do very quickly.

It's gonna have high-level risks,

maybe things that can derail the project,

like delays or cost risks.

It should come with a high-level budget.

Something that they can come up with very quickly.

They can say developing the accounting application

will cost $1 million and take two years.

Notice, it's a high-level number.

It's not very precise particularly.

Now, as we go into the planning section of the project,

then we start to refine our estimates

as we learn more information about the project work.

You wanna make sure you put why you're doing this project,

the purpose of it, the cost benefit of it, for example.

So this is what your charter will contain.

Now, if you're asking me, hey, Andrew,

is there like an example of a project charter?

We really don't have examples of these documents.

PMI did publish a book called

"The Forms of the PMBOK Guide."

You guys can check that out.

But generally, what PMI does is PMI tells you

what these documents should have

and then you make a document,

something that's called a charter,

and you write what it has.

You know, some of these requirements,

and it's just a charter.

The charter is very specific to a particular business.

Generally, your PMO will give you a template for this.

Remember, organization process assets is an input here.

The last output we're gonna talk about

is something called an Assumption Log.

What exactly is an assumption?

Well, assumptions are things that are perceived

to be true that might constrain the project later.

You see, I'm assuming, let's say,

I'm upgrading all my machines to Windows 11,

all the computers in the company.

I'm assuming that all of these machines meets

the hardware requirement that we don't need any hardware.

So the project doesn't include time

and budget for hardware upgrades.

Now, if you think about it this way,

an assumption log is all the things

that you are hoping to be true.

You don't know if it's true or not.

You're just hoping that it's gonna be true.

So you write it down in the assumption log,

and this log is gonna consistently be updated.

Why do you want this?

Well, as you go through the plan

and in the execution of the project,

if your assumption turned out to be false,

you can always say, well, I assumed this.

I didn't make it into a fact.

Remember something, there's a difference

between an assumption and a fact.

An assumption is something that's perceived.

I'm assuming all these machines

in here can handle Windows 11.

But if I go and I check every single one

and I check the hardware requirement

against Windows minimum hardware,

then it's not an assumption anymore.

Let's say, they all pass,

then it's not an assumption, it's a fact.

So if you make assumptions, put it in your assumption log.

Okay. That is the two main output of this process.

Remember, the Project Charter, it's a document.

It's gonna authorize the project or the phase

to get started, and authorizes the project manager

to start the project.

It gives the project manager the authority they need.

It's also gonna have high-level budget,

high-level schedule, and a high-level scope.

The Project Charter is one of the most important documents

because it is the one that starts up the entire project.

-: In this video, I'm gonna give you a quick introduction

to processes, ITTO,

so what's called inputs, tools, techniques, and output.

Now, let's start out by saying

that everything we do in life is a process, right?

Brushing your teeth is a process.

A process, why do we do a process?

A process is done to accomplish a specific goal, all right?

That's the thing.

What is the process done for?

We do a process to accomplish a specific goal.

So why do you brush your teeth?

Well, I want nice, clean teeth, right?

I don't wanna have any cavities or anything like that.

Every time you do a process in life,

there are things that we need to start this process,

they're called inputs.

There are things, oops, wrong button,

there are things that we need to help us

through that process, these are called tools and outputs.

I'm sorry, tools and techniques,

and then there is something called an output,

what we get out of it.

In the world of the 49 processes and project management,

we have the 49 processes,

and these 49 processes have what's called ITTOs

or inputs, tools, techniques, and outputs.

And I'm gonna give you a good set of examples of these

and I wanna make sure you really understand it

before we move on.

So like I said, if you're brushing your teeth,

what's the output of the process of brushing your teeth?

Well, clean teeth.

What's the input to brushing your teeth?

Well, you need toothpaste, toothbrush, water,

mouthwash and a little thing to floss with,

five things, five inputs.

Brushing your teeth, you need a particular technique

on how to brush your teeth.

The technique of putting the toothpaste,

the technique of flossing,

the technique of using the mouthwash the right way.

And then what do you get out of it?

Well, clean teeth, you get no cavities.

That's what you want.

Now, I know this is a simple example,

but how does this relate to project management?

Well let's say I want you

to make me a project management plan.

I says, "I want you to manage this project

and I want you to make a plan of how to do it."

And you're like, "Well, I don't know how to do that."

Well, what if I give you a template, right?

What if I say

"Here's a template that the organization always utilizes."

That would be the input.

So a template would be the input.

For your exam, that would be called

organization, process assets, cover that later on.

So the template would be the input.

Now what are you gonna do?

How are you gonna create this plan?

Well, creating this plan,

let's say you're not sure how to do it,

you've never done it before.

So you call up Peter to help you.

Peter is a subject matter expert,

it's called expert judgment.

That would be a particular technique.

Tool, there are two things, tools and techniques.

Technique is a method of doing something.

A tool is something that can help you,

like a piece of software.

So maybe you can use like Microsoft Project or something.

So that'd be like a tool.

A technique would be hiring an expert to come and help you.

And what do you get out of this?

Well, you get the project management plan.

If I want you to make a project charter,

a document used to authorize a project,

what would be an input?

Well, that template, again, can help you.

But you know when you're making

a charter authorize a project,

you know what else you should think about?

Regulations.

Let's say you're making a project

to introduce a new food product.

You have to think about all the regulations

in the food industry, right?

If you're making a new drug,

you gotta think of all the regulations in there too.

So in that situation,

you would need all the company's regulations,

you would need templates.

That's what's called EEF and OPAs,

Enterprise Environmental Factors

and Organization Process Assets.

Don't worry, we'll cover those later.

The tools and techniques here, you could do meetings,

you would meet a lot of people to create a project charter,

to get a project authorized.

And you would also need help of experts,

expert judgment to help you, and the output,

of course, would be the project charter.

You see, the 49 processes that we have

has many, many ITTOs.

So each one of the 49 processes

has a certain number of inputs,

a certain number of tools, techniques,

those always stay together,

tools and techniques are always together.

And they have a specific output.

How much?

Over 700.

Wait a minute, don't cry, don't cry,

don't go running off yet.

A lot of them are the same.

If you understand one of these, you understand many of them.

In fact, there's not many unique ones.

So what we're gonna do is we're gonna cover

all of the common ITTO's in one section.

And that's gonna eliminate maybe five, 600 of them,

just like that. (snaps finger)

And you'll see that.

Now what I do wanna do is I wanna give you guys

some concrete examples of ITTO's,

and for this, I gotta go back to my process chart

that you guys saw earlier.

So look at this chart that I have here,

all right, look at this chart.

So each one of these has particular ITTO's,

each one of them, like develop project charter.

Develop project charter has an input of those templates

we call organization process assets.

It has a particular tool of expert judgment,

and the output would be what?

If the process is called develop project charter,

what's the output, guys?

Project charter, correct.

So like this one here, define scope.

The input here is a plan of how to define the scope,

the project management plan.

It can also include a template too.

EEF, OPAs, or organization process assets, and so on.

The tools here can be like expert judgment,

because you're not sure how to make a scope,

and the output is of course,

if the process is defined scope, then the output is what?

The scope, right?

So it'd be the scope statement.

And it's the same thing.

All these processes has ITTOs associated with them.

A lot of them have these ITTOs.

Now, one thing I do want to emphasize a lot,

and I'm gonna show you this in the Agile,

in the process group of practice we had,

where we're getting all this data from

is that these processes have the,

they all have pretty much the same.

A lot of them have the exact same ITTO.

So you don't need to memorize like 700 of them,

and I wanna show you this in depth.

Let's take a look.

So I'm back here,

this is the process group or practice guide.

This is their PMI book,

and I wanna show you guys how this book is written.

So you'll notice that it has a first,

it has a couple of chapters right at the beginning,

but then it starts to cover the processes in depth.

And this is the role of the project manager.

I know, I know, I'm scrolling.

Don't worry, we covered all of this.

So look at this, initiating process group.

They tell you the process.

There's two processes,

develop project charter, identify stakeholders.

Now look at how they do it.

They tell you develop project charter,

they tell you what the process is,

and then they give you the inputs, notice the inputs here.

You got what?

Enterprise environmental factors,

organization process assets,

we have expert judgments, we have meetings,

we have interpersonal skills,

and then your output is, of course, a project charter.

There's something called an assumption log.

They do this,

they don't really explain any of these though, okay?

And then they move on to the next process

of identify stakeholders.

And you know this identify stakeholders

also has, look, business documents,

project management plan notes, look,

it has enterprise environmental factors,

organizational process assets,

note this expert judgment is here, meetings are here.

Yeah, output is gonna be a stakeholder register.

So that one is pretty unique.

And then it just moves on to the next section.

Planning, now we know we got a lot of planning process,

24 of them, I told you.

So this part of the book,

they're gonna cover all of these 24 processes.

And one thing, again, I want to point out

is notice the inputs, enterprise environmental factors,

organization process assets,

they have expert judgment, they have meetings,

they have interpersonal skills, data gathering.

Project management plan is the output.

They move on to the next process.

Project management plan, enterprise environmental factors,

or expert judgment, meetings.

Scope management plan is the output here.

And they go on to the next process.

Project management plan, project document,

notes enterprise organization,

process assets, expert judgment.

A lot of things are listed here, interpersonal skills.

And then they give you some outputs.

So what am I showing you, why am I showing you this?

You're probably saying "Why is he showing us that?"

Because what I wanna show you guys is notice the repetition.

Look at the input here, project management plan,

project documents, notice enterprise environmental factor,

organization, expert judgment, interpersonal skills.

You see the point,

what I really am trying to get to in this section is

these 49 processes has pretty much the exact,

a lot of them have the exact same ITTOs.

They have the exact same inputs, tools,

techniques, and outputs.

Now they, a lot of them also contain some very unique ones.

So in this course, what we're gonna do next

is I'm gonna define all the common, common ITTO's.

And the book is written like that.

In the process group of practice guide,

this book we're looking at, in this book,

if you go through it, you're gonna learn about the processes

and then at the end they're gonna tell you

all the common ITTO's and what they mean.

But I'm not gonna do that.

I didn't find that effective

'cause you really don't know what the hell you're reading.

I'm gonna cover all the common ITTO's in the beginning.

We're gonna go through the processes,

gonna get through the processes.

I'm gonna cover the unique,

the ITTO's that are unique to that process when I get there.

So follow along with me.

You're gonna learn all the stuff

that's in this guide for your exam,

and of course in real life.

And maybe you can start applying this stuff in real life.

You know, just don't study this to pass a test,

but study it to become a better project manager.

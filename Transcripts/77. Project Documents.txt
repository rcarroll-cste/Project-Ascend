-: As you study these 49 processes, you're gonna wanna learn

about something called project documents,

and the project management plan.

Because this video, I wanna explain

to you project documents, and we'll start the discussion

of the project management plan.

It's really important that you understand

what these documents are,

and what are the components of a plan because,

what I'm about to show you might scare the hell out of you.

Let's get started.

So the first thing up I wanna talk

about is this thing called project documents.

Now, across the 49 processes, as you're doing them,

you're gonna be creating a variety of documents,

and updating a variety of documents.

And these documents created in one process

can then help you in another process.

So a document output in this process may then be used

as an input to another process.

For example, like what?

Well, let's say you created a document

to estimate the activity duration.

So you know how long a particular task would take,

like how long would it take to paint that wall?

Well, you could then use that estimated duration

to determine the cost.

So the output of this process, the duration estimates,

can then be used as an input to determine

how much this thing will cost to paint the wall.

Because in order to know how much to paint the wall,

guys you need to know

how long the painter is gonna be there.

So a lot of times, these documents are scattered

across these 49 processes, and there's a lot.

There's 33 of them.

Now, as you can see here,

project documents are any documents that are related

to the project.

Project documents are additional, that are created and used,

like I mentioned.

They are not part of the plan.

This is something I wanna really differentiate.

These 33 documents that you're gonna learn

about are not part of the project management plan.

In fact, they're updated consistently.

One thing I want you guys to know is,

the project management plan,

when it's created, is never changed again.

If it needs to be changed for whatever reason,

it needs a change request.

A change request must be initiated for it to change.

The old (indistinct) guides,

and the practical practice guide

may use the term (indistinct) included, but not limited to.

So a lot of times,

what they did was they would tell you that.

They would say, Hey, this process can use these document,

but not limited to.

So they would say, develop project management plan

can use these documents, but it's not limited

to anything else.

Direct to manage project work, which is a a process

where you're gonna be actually doing the work,

they're gonna say, Hey, this process can use these document,

but not limited to.

So in other words, you can basically use all of them.

Now, one of the things that they did do,

is they differentiated what these are.

And what I'm about to show you is gonna be right out

of the process group of practice guide.

You can also find this in PMI Guide sixth edition.

So in this one, and this comes from page 33 of this guide,

you notice that the project management plan

has 18 components.

Now, we're gonna be creating all of these components,

and you will need to know these components

for your exam, and for real life

as you start creating your own plans.

You're gonna wanna know what these things are,

all of these things, and you're gonna wanna know

what's in them.

How are they used.

Now also, you have the 33 project documents here.

You guys see this?

33 project documents, from number one to 33.

Now we're gonna be creating these things,

and as I go through the 49 processes,

I'm gonna be explaining to you guys all of these documents.

We're gonna be creating them,

and I'm gonna tell you what they are, and what they do.

Now on your exam, you better best bet,

you're probably gonna get a few questions,

maybe not a lot, but a few questions

where you have to identify what document to use,

or what document you shouldn't be using.

You may have to identify the components of them.

Now, in the end of the section, in the end of the course

where we download all their additional documents,

I do have a listing of all of these 33 documents,

and what they are.

A nice brief discussion about them.

So it makes it easy to learn.

So just keep in mind that as you go through,

keep in mind that as you guys go through the actual course,

you're gonna be making them.

I'm not gonna go through all of them now.

So I also have another slide here with all of them here,

where they were created.

You guys see that?

All 33 of them.

So if you're looking over the slides,

you wanna know where these documents are coming from,

they're coming from these sections.

So when I cover, when I say this is a scope process,

this is an integration process, this is a quality process,

it'll tell you where they're coming from.

Okay, so as we go through the course,

and we cover these 49 processes,

expect to be creating a whole bunch of documents.

These documents can then be used in other processes

that we may be doing later,

and of course, they're gonna be used as output,

what's called project document updates.

So, because when you finish a particular process,

you might be updating a whole set of these 33 documents.

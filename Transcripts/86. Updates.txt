-: In this video, we're gonna be talking

about a pretty common output.

It's called updates, and particularly, all kinds of updates.

You see, when you finish one of those processes,

you're gonna be updating something.

What?

A particular document,

a particular component of the plan.

For example, if you finish,

if the plan had paint four rooms,

and you finish painting one of rooms

then go back to the plan and mark it

as completed room one.

You may update templates

or also known as organization process assets.

You may update different kinds of knowledge bases.

Maybe you're gonna update different kinds

of organization culture ways

or policies and procedures or guidelines.

As you do your project,

you're gonna be updating a lot of things.

So on many, many of the 49 processes

that we're gonna be talking about,

you guys are gonna see,

one of the output is gonna say,

"Organization process asset updates,

enterprise environmental factor updates,

project document updates,"

and it's gonna say "project management plan updates."

So updates, I'm using this as a catchall term, all right?

What do I mean catchall term?

Catchall term means that you're gonna find a lot of things.

You're gonna find a lot of outputs

that says were updates on them.

And again, this can include updated project documents,

project management plan, OPAs, and EEF.

You're gonna see this

as an output many times throughout this.

My book, "Process Groups: A Practice Guide,"

all the books that basically go over these processes.

So don't be surprised when you see updates listed

on many, many of the processes.

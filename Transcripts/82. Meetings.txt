-: In this video, we're gonna be talking about meetings.

Now, in the previous video,

I looked at interpersonal and team skills.

In there, you also have a part about meeting.

But in this video, it's a tool by itself.

You see, on a project, you're gonna be meeting

with a lot of different stakeholders.

You're gonna be meeting with your customers,

your vendors, your sponsor, your senior management,

obviously your team members and so on.

So you're gonna be meeting with a lot of people.

One of the great things to do

is you wanna be able to manage

those meetings correctly and have those meetings.

Now it's a tool listed on many of the processes

and all it's doing is say,

well, you might be doing a meeting

in order to do this particular process.

Now, like I mentioned, I already went over

a lot of the meeting management techniques

between the previous one.

Let's just do a quick review on it here.

First of all, meetings can be done both virtually

and face-to-face meetings,

depending on the organization

or the style of communication.

Can you remember what dictate this?

If you said the organization,

the enterprise environmental factor,

that is correct.

Not the OPAs, the culture of the business

and the way the business does their work

is considered the EEF.

So this would be like an EEF

would dictate whether it'll probably

be virtual or face-to-face.

One of the things we wanna do,

we must have an agenda and distribute it

to all attendees before the meeting starts.

Then where people know what will be covered in the meeting

and they'll better understand

what they should be bringing and maybe research

that they should be doing before the meeting starts.

Meeting must be timed, including having a start

and finish times for topics and the entire meeting.

Don't do, "This meeting is just gonna be 30 minutes."

What I want you to do is have five topics

and each of them having six minutes, 30 minutes.

When the six minutes is up on a particular topic,

move on to the next one.

Get into the habit of doing this.

You don't wanna spend on limited amount

of time on one topic and before you know it,

now you have to have a meeting about the meeting

or you have to have a meeting

because your meeting didn't cover everything.

This way people get into the habit

of getting to the point and finishing it.

Make sure that the meeting always stays on topic.

Your job is facilitation.

Keeping the team on topic don't branch off

into things that's not needed here.

Let's hope the meeting outputs something useful.

Ensure all attendees have an input.

I mentioned this earlier in the previous video.

If someone doesn't have an input,

what they're saying doesn't matter, okay?

For example, a painter doesn't care

what color you wanna paint your room.

You inviting a painter to determine what color

to paint your wall is probably not useful.

Maybe you and the interior decorator is more than enough.

All the painter needs to know

is what color do you want?

Things like that.

So you have to determine,

does this person actually have an input

or is needed here or are we just wasting

this person's time?

Distribute detailed meeting minutes

once it's complete.

So we wanna make sure that they have a well,

detailed meeting minutes

because we wanna know that when the meeting is done,

everybody understood what the meeting covered

and we wanna make sure that everyone's on the same page

of what we're gonna be doing going forward.

-: Okay, now that you have made the project charter,

in this video,

we're gonna be talking about the next process,

which is to identify your stakeholders.

Now, let's say you were just assigned

and become the authority or the project manager

on a brand new project in your organization.

What's the next thing you're gonna do?

The next thing you should know

is who is this project gonna affect?

And when we say who a project is gonna affect,

if you remember from your definitions or basic terms,

those are called stakeholders.

So in this video, we're gonna be covering the process

of identifying stakeholders.

Now I wanna make something crystal clear to you, guys,

is that this process of identifying stakeholders

is something that you're gonna do on a regular basis,

which means on a continuous basis,

you're gonna be identifying your stakeholders.

Think about this.

Stakeholders come and go.

Stakeholder Mary, for example,

who's the senior stakeholder on your project,

was fired yesterday, replaced by Peter.

Or maybe Peter is the CIO of the business

and Peter was fired also, and he's being replaced by Jane.

Who knows?

Stakeholders will come and go.

And then there are times

when you forgot to identify a particular stakeholder.

So one of the things I want you, guys, to keep in mind

is that this process is gonna be done on a regular basis.

It's not something that you're gonna do just one time.

Every day, all day long, every day that you go to work,

on almost every project,

you're gonna identify

and hopefully be able to know most stakeholders

on your project.

We wanna be able to analyze

and recording relevant information

about their interests and their involvement.

So for example, what interests do they have on this project?

What particular involvement are they gonna be?

Are they gonna be actively or passively involved?

An active participant is like a team member

and a team member will come in and do the actual work.

A passive participant may just stop,

may just sit back and watch the work getting perform.

Think of like customers are more passive

versus team members are gonna be active.

This enables the project team

to identify the appropriate focus for engagement

for each stakeholders or group of stakeholders.

It is important to know what the stakeholders want.

It's important to know their needs of the project

because when you wanna engage them,

you have to see what's the best way to engage them.

If I'm a stakeholder on your project,

the best way to engage a person like me is to talk to me.

I don't like text messages.

I'm not a fan of email

and any kind of written communication.

I like to be spoken to.

I like to do meetings.

I like doing phone conversation and especially face-to-face.

So that's just me.

If I'm a stakeholder, you should know that

and you should know how to keep people like me engaged.

Now it does have quite a lot of inputs.

Now we covered,

these are almost all basic inputs

that we have probably already covered.

We talked about the project charter.

You notice you have that.

Oh, right over there,

we have project charter, business documents.

We talked about PM plans.

All of these here, we covered already,

but there are some tools that I wanna go over

that's pretty unique to this particular process.

And then I want to talk about that unique output

of the stakeholder register.

Now, when it comes to the unique,

there was no unique inputs.

Let's take a look at some unique tools.

And under the the tool of data analysis,

there was this thing called stakeholder analysis.

Stakeholder analysis is a tool that you're gonna use

in order to, as you would imagine,

analyze your stakeholders, things you're gonna ask yourself.

Analyze who your stakeholders are

and how they feel about the project.

Some stakeholders may feel that this is a positive project.

Some may feel that this is a negative project.

What would be the stakeholder's role?

Are they gonna be team members, functional managers?

How would the project affect them?

Is it either positive or negative?

Remember, stakeholders that are losing their job,

probably don't like your project,

they're negatively impacted.

Stakeholders that is making more money

or gaining a promotion from your project

are probably positively impacted.

Would they be active such as team members?

We talked about this.

That means they're gonna be actively involved.

People who work on the deliverable are passive,

such as customers,

people who just sit back and watch the work get done.

What is the power authority?

Are they gonna be playing a very high power role?

In other words, they have a lot of say in on the project.

That's gonna be someone such as a sponsor.

Other tools here we can use

is something called stakeholder mapping and representation.

Now, what exactly is this?

Well, the stakeholder mapping and representation

is gonna be when you can come up

with different kinds of diagrams

to document or plot your stakeholders.

I'll go over a few of them here.

One of them is called a power/interest grid,

power/influence grid.

I'll show you what this looks like.

So a power/interest grid

is when you basically you make a graph,

you say power and you say interest.

And the higher up the stakeholders on this graph,

so this graph goes up like this and like this.

So the more, oh, that's a I, not a T.

So let's take a look at this.

So a stakeholder who's high on the graph,

let's say Bob is here.

So Bob has a lot of power on the project

and he has a big interest.

Maybe because he's a sponsor.

Then you have a customer

who doesn't have much power in the project,

but is very interested, let's say, is Mary.

Let's say you have one.

Let's say you have Jane.

So Jane is someone that has high power on the project,

but not too much interest as much as Bob does.

So in this one, this is called a power/interest grid.

Now the other one here you can use

is called a stakeholder cube.

Stakeholder cube is basically

a three-dimensional methodology

to look at interest, power, and influence.

So in this one you would draw power,

influence, and interest.

So power, influence,

put an I here,

and power, influence, and interest.

So let's say influence, interest, and power at the top.

And then you can put where somebody lies

in this three-dimensional cube.

Now, this one here, not use too much.

We're probably gonna use the power/interest grid more.

Salience model will look at three things

how they're gonna be involved on a project.

For example, the level of authority they have,

like a sponsor has very high level.

The urgency.

Do they need the project right away?

Legitimate.

How appropriate is their involvement in it?

Are they gonna be, again, passively

or actively involved on the project?

Also, you want to think about how much influence they have.

Now, there's four ways,

four types of influence somebody can have on a project:

up, down, out, and sideways.

Let's say this.

Stakeholders who are on top of you,

of course, has a ton of power over you and your project.

Upwards are senior management.

They're higher than you.

Downwards are people below you,

like team members who you may be controlling.

They don't have a lot of influence on you.

Outwards, they can have massive influence on you

because they're outside the organization.

Think of a regulator.

And then you have sidewards or like other project managers

or people with the same power

that you might have to contend with to get resources.

Prioritize your stakeholders.

Prioritization of stakeholders is really understand

who's the top stakeholders.

Who's the one you're gonna want to be most concerned about?

Once you've done these activities,

what you should do now

is to build your stakeholder register.

Now, what exactly is that?

Well, your stakeholder register

is gonna, basically, it's an Excel sheet

that has things such as their contact information,

their first name, their last name, their role on the project

that they're gonna be a sponsor,

how they would like communication.

Maybe you give them meetings.

Maybe you do phone calls with them.

What's their expectations?

For example, when they think this project is gonna be done.

What needs they want?

How are they gonna be affected: positive and negative?

What's their influence level?

We just talked a couple graphs that you can use.

This is gonna be your main output as a stakeholder register.

Now you're gonna use this

to help identify all your stakeholders.

There's some common other outputs like change requests

and a variety of different updates,

but those are common ones.

So when you're thinking of this process

of identify stakeholders,

remember, identifying stakeholders is a process

where you're going to basically do what it says:

identify who are the stakeholders on the project.

Know their contact information,

their interest on the project.

How are they affected by the project?

How does the project affect them

and how do they affect the project?

Think about their influence, for example.

And then make this register.

Of all of their contact information,

how they wanna be communicated with?

How would they be impacted by the project?

Put that all in there.

This document of the stakeholder register

is a document that we're gonna use consistently

throughout the rest of the processes.

For example, when we gather requirement,

we need to know who are the stakeholders.

When we build communication plans,

who are we gonna be communicating with?

So expect to use this document many more times

across all these processes.

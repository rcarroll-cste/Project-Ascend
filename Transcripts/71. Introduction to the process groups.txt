Instructor: In this video,

I'm gonna be talking about predictive project management.

Now we covered some of this in the beginning,

or the intro to this class,

when we covered basic terms.

In this section of the course,

we're gonna be taking a look at

more in-depth predictive projects.

In particular, we're gonna take a look at the 49 processes,

divided into the five process groups,

that forms predictive project management.

You're gonna wanna know these processes for your exam.

So let's get into it.

So, where did I get this content? Where is it coming from?

Well, the first thing up is, before I get into that,

is I want to give you guys a quick reminder.

When do you use predictive project versus adaptive projects?

Remember, adaptive methods are gonna be,

things like Agile approaches are adaptive,

and that's what you're gonna do when the scope is evolving,

when the scope is not known,

when you're trying to build a scope over a period of time.

On a predictive project, the scope is generally known,

and it's not gonna change once the project executes.

Predictive projects can be used

for building a large building,

where you get an approval to build

like, a 50-story skyscraper,

and it'll never change when you start building

the actual deliverable.

Versus on an adaptive project,

you can actually change the scope and modify it

as you're building the product.

So predictive project is managed

generally using the 49 processes

that's outlined in PMI's famous book called

"Process Groups: A Practice Guide."

So what I am getting, all the data,

or I should say the processes that we are getting

for this particular section of the course

is gonna come from the "Process Groups: A Practice Guide."

Now, what exactly is it?

Well, it's the 49 processes that we get out of that book.

It's basically used on predictive projects.

Although some of these processes could be used

in agile projects,

most people following a process-based approach

to project management,

is basically gonna follow these 49 processes.

Now, some agile projects can use some of them,

but not all of them.

But on a predictive project,

you can basically use all of them.

You see, PMI says this.

PMI says that, "This practice guide,"

they're talking about the book,

"Process Groups: A Practice Guide."

"This practice guide identifies the processes

"that are considered good practices on most projects,

"most of the time."

So these 49 processes that I'm gonna be going over,

don't forget, are good practices, best practices,

they're not mandatory practice.

Not every project will follow all of them.

Not every single predictive project that's out there

is gonna follow every single one of these processes.

Not every single project out there

will even use most of them.

Some of them may use some of them.

But for your exam and for studying and purposes only,

I want you to see it as,

"I'm gonna use all of them," all right?

Because on the exam, they're not gonna give an option.

Well, you shouldn't use this.

On the exam, you should know that all predictive projects

are gonna use these processes

because that's the way PMI sees it.

But in real life, you're probably not gonna use

all these processes all the time.

On most projects, most of the time.

And remember, they're considered best practices,

not the only practice

or a mandatory practice that you have to follow.

Now I wanna show you what these processes look like.

All right, I want to give you guys the heads up

on these processes to scare the hell out of you.

Now when you see this, don't quit the course

and stop studying.

They're not that difficult. It looks complex.

I'm gonna give you an amazing introduction to them.

I'm gonna explain every single one of them to you.

I'll explain what's called input tools,

and outputs to them,

and you'll get a good understanding of what they are.

And then I'll put them all together later on in the course.

So here we go with the 49 processes

that is outlined in the "Process Groups: A Practice Guide."

And this comes from page 22 of that study guide,

or that book.

So if you look above me,

you can see that the first thing up we want to talk about

are that these 49 processes that are listed there,

are broken into five process group.

Now the book itself, the "Process Groups: A Practice Guide,"

is broken into five sections

describing the five process groups

that projects will follow.

Let's go over and take a look at what they are.

So the first thing up we have is initiating.

Now you notice initiating has two processes.

Initiating, when you initiate a project,

initiating is about keeping,

it about getting project authorized.

Every time you guys hear the word "initiate,"

think of getting the project authorized.

There's only two processes that are listed here,

that's gonna be "develop the project charter"

and "identify your stakeholders."

Now we're gonna get into the more nitty gritty,

or the more detailed information on these processes.

But for now, I want you guys to know

a project charter is the document

that gets a project authorized.

It's like the quote unquote authorization document

of a project.

So initiating, "develop the project charter,"

that's gonna be the first process

that I'm gonna teach you guys

coming up a little bit later.

Now let's take a look.

"Develop project charter,"

then "identify your stakeholders,"

knowing who are your stakeholders.

So you're authorizing a project,

you've been assigned a project manager,

you're gonna know who your stakeholders are.

Next one.

The next thing here,

the other process group they talk about,

is something called planning.

Planning is gonna be about putting together

the entire project management plan.

Now before you can execute a project,

execution is about doing work.

Before you can actually start doing work on a project,

don't you think it's good to have a plan in place,

that how are you going to manage your scope?

Like what if there's somebody wants to change the scope,

how do they do that?

What happens if the project goes off scope?

What if the project goes off budget?

How do you do that?

Do you even know what work to do, when to do it,

how to do it?

Do you know who should be doing what work?

That is something we're gonna want to put together

in a project management plan.

Now, the project management plan has 24 processes,

and you can see that there is quite a lot of these processes

that is listed here.

And once again, guys, we are gonna be going through

every single one of these processes.

I'm gonna give you guys,

I'm gonna tell you guys what they are

and how you can apply them.

So 24 processes.

Combined, these 24 processes will give you

the project management plan,

which is basically a document

that's gonna tell you how to execute,

how to monitor and control, and how to close your project.

Once planning is done, guys, you're gonna execute,

and you're going to monitor and control

the project together.

What does this mean?

Well, executing is about starting the work.

When you think execution, think of work.

Think of, "Okay, the project is executed now."

Let's say the project was to paint this room.

Now let's go and start painting the actual room.

You'll notice that you have basically 10 processes here.

And this one, a lot of this here deals with

acquiring the people and the physical materials,

developing and managing your team,

managing risk, selecting a vendor

are some of the things you're gonna be doing here.

So, 10 processes listed here

that we have to go through in here.

Now remember, execution is about doing work.

Once that work is getting done,

you notice I have a double face arrow,

once the work is getting done, what do you have to do?

You have to make sure that the work is getting done

according to the plan.

You see, one of the things that,

one of the things that happens when we manage a project,

one of the things that we, as project managers,

should be doing is,

once the work is getting done,

once the the painter is painting the room,

the software developer is coding the application,

once they're doing that,

we, as a project manager,

have to make sure that they stay on actual budget.

We wanna make sure that they stay on schedule,

we wanna make sure they're doing the right work.

Like you come into the room,

and you see the painter is painting the room,

you gotta look back and say,

"Oh, is he doing the right job here?

"Is he actually doing the job

"that was supposed to get done?"

Maybe, maybe not. So let's see.

So in this particular one, in monitoring and controlling,

we are gonna be monitoring the work, watching the work,

and controlling it to make sure it gets done.

So monitor is more like watching.

Controlling is telling them what to do.

So we're going to go through these 11 processes

that we need to go through in this section

of monitoring and controlling.

So in this one we're looking at, we're saying,

"Okay, are we on schedule, are we on budget,

"are we on scope, are we following the right risk,

"are we monitoring risk," and so on.

Finally, as you do the work,

you monitor and control the work, and you finish the work,

you're gonna have to close out your project.

Just one process here.

So, closing is gonna be where you're gonna

formally bring the project to a complete close.

It's gonna be when you're going to close out the project,

release the project team, archive the project records,

and transfer the deliverable.

So that's what these 49 processes,

that you guys see here, are about.

Now, if you're saying,

"Okay, that's not so bad to understand.

"So I initiate it, right, I actually get it approved,

"get the project approved, start the project, plan it.

"I put together a plan, execute it.

"I start the work, monitor and controlling,

"I monitor and control the work,

"make sure the work stays on plan,

"and then I close it and I'm done."

Now, if this sounds pretty easy to understand,

then yeah, it's pretty easy to understand.

And once again, you can see all these processes

all listed here on the slide here.

Now these processes, you know,

they don't look so difficult to understand.

But, I'm gonna make this a little difficult for you.

Now you're probably saying, "Why does he wanna do that?"

Because, well, you need to know this.

So if you guys remember what a phase is,

remember what a phase is, who makes up phases, all right?

This was covered in the beginning of the class.

Who makes up a phase?

A phase is made up, by who?

By project managers, right?

Who makes up a phase?

A project manager determines the phases on a project.

What are the phases?

It's the life cycle of the project.

It's everything that we go through from beginning to end.

What are the phases?

Well, let's say you're using these predictive projects,

you're using predictive for software development.

So what are you gonna do?

Well, you have to design the software,

you have to code the software,

you have to test the software,

you have to release the software.

So four phases.

You see, these 49 processes, they're objective.

Like, what's the main goal of these 49 processes?

49 processes will output a deliverable.

Now these 49 processes does not actually,

these 49 processes does not actually live within

the entirety of the project itself.

It lives in every phase of the project.

So, if you're doing those four phases,

design, develop or code, test, install,

if you're doing those four phases,

every single phase would have these 49 processes.

So designing would have all of these 49 processes.

Coding, all 49 processes.

So let me give you an example.

So let's say you're designing the software.

You're going to do what?

You're going to get a charter for it.

You're gonna identify stakeholders in the design end.

You're gonna plan how to design.

You're gonna execute and monitor and controlling

the design of itself.

And then we're gonna close off design.

Notice how this last process is called

"close project or phase."

The other thing here

is when you move on to the next phase now,

which is gonna be coding,

well that one has its own initiating.

You're gonna have to get a charter for it,

you're gonna have to plan it,

you're gonna have to execute the coding to actually code it.

Then you're gonna monitor and control it,

and then you're gonna close it.

They each is gonna give you a deliverable.

If you think about this,

if you're designing, the output is the schematics,

or the design diagrams.

If you use these 49 processes that I have here,

then by the time you finish these 49 processes,

you're gonna have the design schematics.

If you're coding, you're gonna follow these 49 processes,

and eventually you're gonna have the coded software.

If you're follow these 49 processes and you're testing,

you're gonna have the test results.

The main objective that I want you guys to understand

is that, in these 49 processes,

you have to understand that, basically, what you're doing

is you're using these 49 processes to build the deliverables

on the project every single phase.

Now, if your project has one phase,

then these 49 processes is only gonna be done that time.

You only do it once.

So I want you guys to remember now,

these 49 processes lives in every phase of the project.

If you have multiple phases in a project,

then you're gonna be doing these 49 processes a lot.

The "Process Groups: A Practice Guide,"

which was formally known as "PMBOK Guide," sixth edition,

does say one thing.

A project will follow most of these processes

most of the time.

And they just don't follow them once,

a lot of times we follow them multiple times.

For example, the process of identify stakeholders,

as you guys can see,

there is a process called identify stakeholders.

You think about this, when do you identify stakeholder?

All the time.

Stakeholders comes and goes.

Mary's a stakeholder today, but Mary left the company.

Now Bob is.

Always keep identifying your stakeholders.

Things like identify risks,

you're gonna be doing all the time.

You know what that process is?

And this is what it says it is,

you're gonna be knowing the risk on your project.

So identify risk is something you do consistently,

because risk changes every single day.

Every day you wake up, there's a new risk in this world

that can hurt you or hurt your project.

Okay, very good guys.

Hopefully you guys got this.

These are gonna be the 49 processes.

Now, as we go through this course,

this section, this course,

what we're gonna be doing is we're gonna be

looking at those 49 processes.

We're gonna be looking at some of their ITTOs,

and we're gonna understand what they are.

So whenever, if you ever have to manage a project

in a predictive environment using these processes,

you'll know exactly what they are.

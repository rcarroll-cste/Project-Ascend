I'm gonna tell you about enterprise environmental factors.

Now, this is gonna be one of the most common inputs

that you're gonna find across the 49 processes.

And let's see what it is.

The first thing up I'll tell you guys

is every single company that you go to work for

will have their own quote unquote unique methods,

ways, laws, culture, that they do business.

The way that you get a project charter approved

in one business is gonna be vastly different

then the way you use that, you get in another business.

The laws and regulations that certain companies follow,

others don't follow them.

Maybe one company's healthcare and the other one is finance.

Every company has a variety of unique things that they do.

In other words, a unique culture.

Every time I hear the word enterprise environmental factor

or from now on we'll say EEF, company culture comes to mind.

I think culture.

You say EEF, I say culture.

That's the way I see it.

But let's see what it is.

These are things that impact the project

but are not part of the project itself.

It influenced the organization, the projects,

and its outcomes.

So it's gonna be things that are gonna impact your project,

but basically it's not part of the project.

The project isn't to do it.

And I'll give you a list

of what's a lot of these things are.

It's essential to consider these internal

and external factors.

So we know that they're internal and they're external,

while planning the project to determine their influence.

They can enhance or they can even constrain the project.

For example, the way a company's structured,

or it's basically it's authority level, could make it easy,

or that same authority level could make it harder

to get a project approved.

Certain kinds of regulations

could make things easier for you,

or certain regulations can really restrict your business.

Those are different kinds

of enterprise environmental factors.

Here is a list of some of these, "EEF."

Now, I told you that they're really broken

into two sections, internal and external.

Internal could be the company's structure

and the governance.

This is gonna be how, who's in charge,

and the way things gets approved.

Do they have a board of directors?

Is it just a company owner?

Is there a CEO?

Is there a president?

You know, what's the structure of this business?

The overall company's culture.

Their appetite for risk.

Some companies are more willing to accept risk than others

and some companies are no risk at all.

Some companies are more conservative

and some companies are more opened up towards risk.

How do they get about communications?

What are the challenges of communication?

Can you just walk through the door of your CEO,

or do you have to like, schedule an appointment?

The information technology that they use.

Different companies use different tech.

Some companies don't use Microsoft project.

Some company like mines uses it particularly.

The distribution of facility and resources.

Some companies are virtual, all work from home,

like PMI actually is.

And some companies are all in person.

The infrastructure of the technology.

How available resources and some company has a wide variety

of employees and capabilities, and some don't.

That's probably gonna depend on the size.

These are gonna be internal factors.

These are factors that is built into the business.

Now, external things that can affect your project

is gonna be the political climate.

I'm not gonna get into politics in this class,

but if you know, politics in any country

can affect all projects in the entire country.

Government standards or industry standards that you follow.

If you're in construction, the standard you follow

there's a lot different than if you're in healthcare.

Commercial databases, different kinds of legal restrictions.

So if you have any kind of laws and regulation

that needs to get followed, you gotta put that there.

And financial consideration,

whether that's financing large projects

or getting internal financing.

So these are gonna be internal and external EEF.

And if you're wondering how does this affect the project,

well, here's what I want you guys to know.

EEF is an input into every,

almost every one of those 49 processes.

And the question is why?

Well, lemme give you some examples.

Let's say you're making a project management plan.

Let me ask you a question.

Would laws and regulation affect that plan?

Yes.

'Cause if there's particular laws you need to follow,

you need to include it in the plan.

If your developing a project charter,

would the where the structure of the business matter?

Yeah, because you wanna get that charter approved,

you have to know how or where to go.

You want to manage the pro,

you wanna execute the project?

Well, you have to know what type

of technology solution they use, right?

This is gonna tell you, do you use Microsoft Project,

or do you, do you just use Excel?

How do you close a project?

What's the procedure for that?

There's so many things in a project

that can be affected by things inside of the business,

the quote unquote, the company culture.

EEF is something very specific to businesses.

Every single company you work at

is gonna have a different quote unquote, EEF.

Technically it's all the same thing by definition.

Like, "oh, we have a computer system."

But the computer system that company uses

is different than others.

Okay, hopefully this makes sense because this is,

EEF is gonna be one of the most common input

along with another thing we'll cover soon called OPA's.

Those are gonna be the two most common inputs

in the entire course.

-: In this video, I'm gonna be talking

about another common input we call OPA,

or organization process assets.

And what exactly is that?

Anytime you hear this term, OPAs,

I want you guys to think templates.

That's the easiest way to remember it.

You see OPAs are things that are provided to you

by the business to help progress your projects.

And the most common one is gonna be a template.

It can also include software tools,

or previous lesson learned.

But there are a lot of things

that the company can provide you when you start a project.

For example, if you wanna develop a project charter,

would a template be helpful to you?

If I say, "Hey, Bob, can you make this project charter?"

And you say, "Well, I'm not sure how to."

And I say, "Well, here's a template.

Fill this out."

That'll be pretty helpful, right?

These are gonna be used as inputs and it's a common input.

Let's take a look at what OPAs are.

So OPAs are things that the organization,

they're basically assets that the organization have.

This is gonna be, one of the most common one

is gonna be knowledge or information,

policies, procedures, documents, or knowledge bases.

Some of us have these large knowledge base systems

that we store all the company's knowledge.

They're basically, previous lesson learned

which are called OPAs.

Now, what PMI did here was, they took all of the,

it's basically a catchall terms for things that a PMO,

or a project management office would give you.

Like, again, like a template,

or maybe particular software tools,

or particular guidelines to follow

and close on a project, for example.

These things are generally kept in a central repository.

A lot of companies may have like a Microsoft SharePoint site

that does this so that they can be used whenever required.

They can affect all aspects of a project.

Again, this is one of the most common inputs

you're gonna find to many processes.

The project team update

and add to the organization process assets.

For example, let's say, you finished a project

and you had a template that you created

for like a risk register or an issue log.

You cannot add that back

into the organization repository of templates.

So we update these OPAs throughout the project.

And some examples are gonna be templates, software tools,

historical information, things like from previous projects,

guidelines to close out a procedure,

policies of how to manage risk and managing changes.

And then of course, how do we deal with defects

and issues on a project.

These are gonna be some of them.

Now, as you can imagine, or if you can think about,

go back to previous projects you have used or have done,

you're probably seeing yourself,

well, my company provided me a lot of things.

Maybe they gave you Microsoft project,

maybe they gave you a template for the charter,

maybe they gave you a template for the project plan,

maybe they gave you guidelines or procedures

of how to close this project,

or how to build this plan, or how to manage risk,

that's all OPAs.

So OPAs is gonna affect pretty much all of the 49 processes.

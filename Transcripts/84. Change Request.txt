-: In this video, we're gonna be talking

about one of the most common outputs

that you're gonna find across many of the processes

in executed, monitored control,

and it's gonna be change requests.

What exactly is this?

Before I get into it, let's talk a little about planning.

So you go through all these planning processes.

If you remember, there 24 of these planning processes.

The output of all of these 24 planning processes

is gonna be your project management plan.

Now, the project management plan

should not be changed at all.

Once that project executes,

this plan should never see changes.

No one should be changing the plan

unless you get an approved change request.

You see, there will come times in the project

where changes may be needed.

For example, maybe you need more money.

Maybe you underestimated how much money you need

or how much time you need.

Maybe there come a point where the customer

just changes their mind,

and they're like, "Well, this is too much,"

or, "We don't need all these features,"

and they wanna remove parts of the scope,

or maybe the customer wants to add to the scope.

You see, once a plan has been approved

and the project work is started,

nothing can change that plan

except an approved changed request.

In other words, somebody requested a change,

the change got assessed, and it was approved.

Now, another thing a change request can do

is maybe you're managing a project,

and you need additional time because you underestimated.

Now, one of the common things, and this is really common,

one of the common outputs here is this particular output

of, say, change requests.

And I want you to understand that a change request

is what we're gonna use to change a particular document

or a particular component on a plan.

So a change request is a proposal

to change a document, deliverable, or a baseline.

So you could change any component

of the PM plan, any project document.

It could modify deliverables,

and it could maybe extend a time, shorten a time.

Sometimes, a customer comes and says,

"Can you make your project quicker?

Can you make it cheaper?

Can you add this or remove this?"

These are all change requests.

Can include a change to add or remove work from scope,

finish the project faster, or complete the project cheaper,

or I should say more cost effective.

Now, don't think (stylus scratching)

of change requests as just something

that a customer will come and ask.

Don't think change requests are things

that Mary, the senior stakeholder

wants you to implement.

No, change requests sometimes are issued by you.

You actually go out

and issue a change request or request a change.

Why? Because maybe something went wrong on your projects.

Two things in particular: corrective and preventive actions.

Corrective actions is something that's taken

to ensure the project gets back on track,

versus preventive action is something you put in place

to ensure the project stays on track.

Now, let me give you some examples.

Corrective actions is when one day,

you wake up, and you realize your project

is just off budget or it's off schedule.

So you go to the boss,

and you ask for more time or more costs or both.

That's a corrective action.

It's already broken.

Now, what can I do to get it back on schedule?

The other one is called a preventive action,

so a preventive action is something you're gonna put

in place to stop it in the future

from going off plan. (watch rustling)

So preventive action is when you say,

when you look at your plan and you say, "Hmm,

in two weeks from now, based on how we're working,

we're gonna be off schedule.

Let's go and request more money and/or more time

to fix this now."

That's a preventive action.

So you're stopping the project from going off plan.

(hands scraping) Another thing

that we wanna talk about is defect repair.

This is done to fix a broken component on a project.

For example, if you have different kinds of IT failures

on a project, you might need to fix those things,

or different kinda project components that fails,

you can fix it with defect repair.

Now, as I go (stylus clattering)

through the 49 processes,

you guys will see that change request is a very common one.

As I get to it too, I'll give you some more hints and tips

on where we can use it, but keep in mind: a change request

is used to change the project management plan.

It's when somebody wants to change a component of the plan.

Now, if somebody requests a change,

it doesn't mean the plan will change.

This is just a request for change.

The change has to be assessed,

and if the change is approved,

then, it may change a document,

a plan component such as a baseline, and our deliverables.

So keep that in mind.

Not because you request a change

means it's gonna get approved.

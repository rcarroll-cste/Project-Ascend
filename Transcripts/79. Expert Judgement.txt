-: One common tool that you're gonna find

in your study guides are gonna be expert judgment.

What exactly is it?

This video, I'll explain it.

First of all, we could always use the help of others.

If you're ever doing a particular task,

you're making a plan, you're managing an issue,

you're managing risks, you're managing vendors,

you're managing quality, you're managing people in general,

you're learning how to create a scope or create a schedule,

you can always ask someone for help.

That's what expert judgment is.

Expert judgment is a tool that we use across the 49 process,

and many of them has as a tool that helps us

to get the job done.

It basically is, oh, if you're doing a particular process

and you're not sure how to do it,

then the best thing to do is to ask someone how to do it,

get some help.

That's gonna be your subject matter experts.

So it's gonna be one of the most common tool in planning.

It basically includes hiring an expert

or a subject matter expert

to help you plan a particular process

or even conduct a process.

So it's not just a tool that we're gonna use

on planning a project, we're also gonna use

the execute, monitoring & controlling and close a project.

Basically, expert judgment is people

with specialized knowledge or train a particular industry,

process, industry, or technology.

So don't think of expert judgment

as just a particular consultant.

Think about it as team members

that are just trained in programming.

They can help you estimate.

You think about this,

if I ask you how long will it take to paint this room,

this is a pretty big studio we have.

This room is, I don't know, maybe a thousand square foot.

So if you think about it,

how long would it take to paint that?

Do you know?

Probably not.

But if I call a painter, somebody who specializes

in the industry of painting, and I say,

"I got a thousand square foot, can you help?

Can you tell me how long?"

He'd probably gimme a good idea of how long it'll take.

Better than me and you would

because, hey, I'm not a painter, maybe you're not too.

That's expert judgment.

Don't forget, this is one of the most common tools

we're gonna use across the 49 processes.

Because lemme tell you guys something,

we can always use the help

of people that are smarter than us.

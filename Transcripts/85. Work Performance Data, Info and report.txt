-: In this video,

I'm gonna be going over work performance data,

information and report.

These are common outputs that you're gonna find

on many of the processes in executing,

monitor and control and then in closing.

And you really have to understand what exactly is it.

So I'm gonna give you guys a bunch of examples with it

and I'll show you guys how it flows.

So the first thing is up is what exactly are these things?

Well, when you manage a project,

when a project is executed

and the team members are actually doing the job,

they're actually painting the room,

they're coding the application,

they're building that big building,

you're gonna be getting information from them.

And particularly data such as

how much have they done so far?

How much money they spent?

When did they start?

When did they finish?

This is known as work performance data.

Now, work performance data is just raw information

about the work that they did.

Work performance data comes

from the executing section of the project.

This is given to you again by team members.

You then take the work performance data

and you compare it up against the plan.

Should they have started this day?

Did they actually start that day?

You're gonna compare what work they did.

They told you they paint the wall white in the data.

The plan said you should paint the wall off white.

Well, that's a problem now because

it should have been white,

they paint off white.

Now what you're doing here

is you're comparing the actual work against the plan.

This is how you monitor and control a project by the way.

In monitor and control

and what you're doing

is that you are seeing the work that they did.

Did it line up with the plan?

Remember what monitoring and controlling is about

keeping your project on plan.

You guys remember that?

So this is gonna give us what's called

work performance information.

So work performance data is raw information,

work performance information

is the actual data compared to the plan.

Are we off schedule?

Are we off budget?

Are we off scope?

What's happening with this project?

Now then you take all this information.

Now information comes in parts,

there's information for scope,

information for schedule.

You take all this information

and then what you're gonna do

is you are going to put it into a report.

So work performance report.

The report is gonna give us the overall status

of the project.

Now the report is basically the combination

of all of the work performance information.

I want to show you a chart.

Now this comes out of the book,

the PMI's book Process Group: A Practice Guide.

Again, you can also find us in PEMBA Guide sixth edition.

And I want you guys notice in the executing process

you're gonna get work performance data.

Work performance data is fed

into all the monitoring and controlling processes

as to raw information.

Remember, if you think about this,

to monitor and control a particular,

like if you're monitoring, controlling your scope,

if I say keep that project on scope

while the team's doing the work,

what do you need to know?

You need to know what was the plan scope,

the plan and you need to know what work they did

or what work are they gonna do

and when are they gonna start this work?

How much are you gonna spend?

So it's the scope and the time and the cost.

You're gonna take this data

and what are you gonna do with this data?

You're gonna compare it against the plan.

So this data plus the plan

equals the work performance information.

You then take all this work performance information.

This gives you the overall project control.

Is the project in and out of control?

And you put this into a report.

Now this report is given to many things.

This report is gonna be given

to the project change control procedures

because if somebody asks for a change,

you're gonna need to know are we actually

on schedule or are we off schedule?

Well, that's what the report's gonna tell you.

This report is gonna be given to stakeholders,

particularly team members

or all the stakeholders that are there.

Why? Because your boss may need to ask.

They're gonna come and ask you many times,

are you on or off schedule?

This report can also use in,

this report, if a change is approved,

that approved change will then update

various different kinds of processes out there.

So these are gonna be the three things.

Work performance data, information and report.

Now I do have a couple of other slides I do wanna review

with you to do a quick recap since I went over it.

Let's go through this quickly.

So what is work performance data?

One more time, quick recap.

Well, that is simply raw information.

The status of the work that was done

but does not have any analysis.

It's not useful by itself.

You see, if I told you that I paint this room white

and I spent two days and $200,

what does that mean to you?

Not much, right?

Because you don't know what the plan is.

You don't know am I doing good or am I doing bad?

All you know is what I did?

It's usually the output of the executing processes.

Now, work performance information

is the information of the work

that was performed compared to the plans.

This is gonna be the big one.

You take the data,

you compare it against the plan.

It gives you the actual status about deliverables.

It's usually the output of most monitoring and controlling.

So if you look at monitoring and controlling process,

you'll find this thing as the output.

Now, taking all this information,

we're gonna put this together

in the overall status report of the project.

It takes all the work performance information put together

to give you this one comprehensive document.

So remember, this is the document

that you're gonna be giving out to your stakeholders

as we saw in that process flow diagram from PMI.

You take the work performance data.

How do we get it?

Well, you take the work performance data

and compare it against the plan

to come up with the work performance information.

Then you take all the information

and create the work performance report.

Remember, data feeds into info

and all the info creates the reports.

That's what I need you guys to know.

Data is raw information compared against the plan,

you get the information,

take all the information, create a report.

That's the the flow that I need you guys to know this in.

Now you guys will be seeing WPD,

Work Performance Data,

work performance info

and work performance report quite a lot

as we go through this forty nine process

especially in the executing,

monitoring and controlling processes.

Make sure you understand how they flow.

Data is used,

data is raw information that is then combined

that is then versus the plan to create the information

and all the information combined creates the report.

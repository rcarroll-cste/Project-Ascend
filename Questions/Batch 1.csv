"Initiating","Develop Project Charter","A project manager is assigned to a new infrastructure project. The sponsor asks the project manager to immediately start ordering materials to beat a pending price increase. The project charter has not yet been signed. What should the project manager do?","A. Order the materials to save the budget.","B. Create a risk entry regarding the price increase and wait for the charter.","C. Request a verbal authorization from the sponsor to proceed.","D. Refuse to take any action until the project management plan is complete.","B","Solution: B. The Project Charter authorizes the project and the project manager. Without it, the PM has no authority to spend money. The best action is to document the risk of the price increase but wait for the formal authorization (Charter) before spending funds. Option A and C violate PMP ethics/process. Option D is incorrect because you need a Charter before you even have a Project Management Plan."
"Initiating","Develop Project Charter","A multinational company is launching a project to enter a new market. The business case indicates high profitability, but the project manager notices that the high-level risks in the draft charter suggest a 60% chance of regulatory failure. What should the project manager do before the charter is approved?","A. Update the risk register with mitigation strategies.","B. Discuss the misalignment between the business case and high-level risks with the sponsor.","C. Remove the risks from the charter to ensure approval.","D. Proceed to the Plan Risk Management process immediately.","B","Solution: B. The Project Charter includes high-level risks. If the risks threaten the validity of the Business Case (the economic feasibility), the PM must discuss this with the sponsor before the project is formally authorized. You cannot update a risk register (Option A) or Plan Risk Management (Option D) because those artifacts don't exist yet."

Smoothing","B. Forcing","C. Withdrawal","D. Problem Solving (Collaborating)","D","Solution: D. Problem Solving (Collaborating) is the preferred method for resolving conflicts, especially during initiation where buy-in is critical. The PM should work with the stakeholder to understand the budget concerns and correct the data if necessary. Forcing (B) or Withdrawal (C) will lead to long-term issues."

"Planning","Create WBS","A project manager is breaking down the project deliverables into smaller, more manageable components. The team stops when they reach the lowest level of the hierarchy, where cost and duration can be reliably estimated. What is this level called?","A. Planning Package","B. Control Account","C. Work Package","D. Activity","C","Solution: C. The Work Package is the lowest level of the WBS. It is the point at which the cost and duration of the work can be reliably estimated and managed."
"Planning","Create WBS","The project sponsor asks to see the 'Scope Baseline'. Which three documents must the project manager present?","A. Project Scope Statement, WBS, and WBS Dictionary","B. Project Charter, Scope Statement, and WBS","C. WBS, Schedule Baseline, and Requirements Documentation","D. Scope Management Plan, WBS, and WBS Dictionary","A","Solution: A. The Scope Baseline consists of three specific documents: The Project Scope Statement, the WBS, and the WBS Dictionary."
"Planning","Create WBS","A team member is confused about the specific details of a Work Package listed in the WBS.

The WBS Dictionary","C. The Activity List","D. The Requirements Traceability Matrix","B","Solution: B. The WBS Dictionary provides the detailed information about each component in the WBS, including acceptance criteria, assumptions, and responsible parties."
"Planning","Create WBS","During a scope review, the project manager notices a task being performed that is not in the WBS. What does this indicate?","A. The WBS is incomplete, or scope creep is occurring.","B. The team is being proactive.","C. The critical path has changed.","D. The project is under budget.","A","Solution: A. The 100% Rule states that the WBS represents 100% of the project scope. If work is being done that is not in the WBS, it is either unauthorized (scope creep) or the WBS is missing authorized work."
"Planning","Create WBS","In an agile project, how is the concept of a WBS typically represented?","A. It is not used at all.","B. By the Product Backlog, decomposed into Epics, Features, and User Stories.","C. By the Sprint Burndown Chart.","D. By the Retrospective notes.","B","Solution: B. While agile doesn't always use a formal WBS, the decomposition of scope is handled via the Product Backlog, breaking large items (Epics) into smaller items (User Stories)."

This is an example of defining:","A. Units of Measure and Reporting Formats","B. The Critical Path","C. Resource Optimization","D. Schedule Compression","A","Solution: A. The Schedule Management Plan defines the Units of Measure (e.g., hours vs. days) and Reporting Formats (e.g., frequency of updates)."
"Planning","Plan Schedule Management","A project manager is using an adaptive (agile) life cycle. How does the Schedule Management Plan differ from a predictive one?","A. It will require a fixed Gantt chart for the whole year.","B. It will likely use on-demand scheduling or iterative scheduling with a backlog.","C. It focuses only on the Critical Path Method.","D. It does not require any planning.","B","Solution: B. In adaptive lifecycles, the plan focuses on shorter cycles (iterations) or on-demand scheduling (Kanban) rather than a long-term fixed schedule."
"Planning","Plan Schedule Management","Which of the following is NOT an output of the Plan Schedule Management process?","A. Schedule Management Plan","B. Project Schedule","C. None (It produces a plan, not a schedule)","D. Updates to the Project Management Plan","B","Solution: B. The Project Schedule (the actual timeline) is created in the 'Develop Schedule' process. This process only creates the *plan* for how to manage the schedule."
"Planning","Plan Schedule Management","The project manager consults the Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEF) while planning the schedule. Which of the following is an EEF?","A. Scheduling software available in the organization","B. Templates from previous projects","C. Lessons learned repository","D. Change control procedures","A","Solution: A. Scheduling software is a tool/system provided by the organization's environment (EEF). Templates and lessons learned are Organizational Process Assets (OPA)."

What is this technique called?","A. Progressive Elaboration","B. Rolling Wave Planning","C. Decomposition","D. Precedence Diagramming","B","Solution: B. Rolling Wave Planning is an iterative planning technique where the work to be accomplished in the near term is planned in detail, while the work in the future is planned at a higher level."
"Planning","Define Activities","Which list includes all schedule activities and a description of the scope of work for each activity in sufficient detail?","A. Activity Attributes","B. Milestone List","C. Activity List","D. WBS","C","Solution: C. The Activity List is a comprehensive list that includes all schedule activities required on the project."

Start-to-Start (SS)","B. Finish-to-Finish (FF)","C. Start-to-Finish (SF)","D. Finish-to-Start (FS)","D","Solution: D. Finish-to-Start (FS) is the most common relationship: The successor (B) cannot start until the predecessor (A) has finished."
"Planning","Sequence Activities","The team identifies that 'Pouring Concrete' must happen before 'Framing', simply due to the physical nature of the work. This is what type of dependency?","A. Discretionary Dependency","B. Mandatory Dependency","C. External Dependency","D. Internal Dependency","B","Solution: B. Mandatory dependencies (Hard Logic) are legally or contractually required or inherent in the nature of the work (e.g., you must build the foundation before the roof)."

This 5-day overlap is represented as:","A. Lag","B. Lead","C. Float","D. Slack","B","Solution: B. A Lead is the amount of time a successor activity can be advanced with respect to a predecessor (an overlap). A Lag is a delay."
"Planning","Sequence Activities","Which diagramming method is used to represent the sequence of activities and their dependencies?","A. Pareto Chart","B. Precedence Diagramming Method (PDM)","C. Scatter Diagram","D. Control Chart","B","Solution: B. The Precedence Diagramming Method (PDM) is used to construct a schedule model in which activities are represented by nodes and linked by dependencies (Project Schedule Network Diagrams)."

Internal Dependency","C. External Dependency","D. Soft Logic","C","Solution: C. External dependencies involve a relationship between project activities and non-project activities (e.g., government hearings, supplier deliveries)."
"Planning","Estimate Activity Durations","A project manager asks an expert to estimate a task. The expert says, 'It usually takes 10 days, but if things go great, it could be 8. If everything breaks, it could take 18.' Using Beta PERT (Weighted Average), what is the estimate?","A. 10 days","B. 11 days","C. 12 days","D. 13 days","B","Solution: B. Beta PERT Formula = (Optimistic + 4*MostLikely + Pessimistic) / 6. Calculation: (8 + 4*10 + 18) / 6 = (8 + 40 + 18) / 6 = 66 / 6 = 11 days."

Analogous Estimating","B. Parametric Estimating","C. Bottom-Up Estimating","D. Planning Poker","B","Solution: B. Parametric Estimating uses a statistical relationship between relevant historical data and other variables (e.g., square footage) to calculate an estimate."
"Planning","Estimate Activity Durations","A team member adds a 2-week 'buffer' to their estimate just to be safe, without identifying specific risks. This is a common problem known as:","A. Padding","B. Contingency Reserve","C. Management Reserve","D. Crashing","A","Solution: A. Padding is adding extra time/cost without a valid risk basis. Proper risk management adds 'Reserves' (Contingency for known risks, Management for unknown risks). Padding is discouraged."
"Planning","Estimate Activity Durations","In an agile poker planning session, the team uses Fibonacci numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 8...) to estimate user stories. What are they estimating?","A. Exact hours","B. Relative size/effort (Story Points)","C. Dollar cost","D. Calendar dates","B","Solution: B. Agile teams often use Story Points to estimate the relative magnitude or effort of work, rather than specific time durations."
"Planning","Develop Schedule","The project manager calculates the schedule and finds that the Critical Path is 50 days long. What does this mean?","A. The project can be finished in 40 days if needed.","B. The project will take at least 50 days to complete.","C. All activities have 50 days of float.","D. Resources are available for 50 days.","B","Solution: B. The Critical Path is the longest path through the network diagram, which determines the shortest possible duration of the project. It dictates the minimum time needed."
"Planning","Develop Schedule","You need to shorten the project schedule by 2 weeks without changing the scope. You decide to add 3 extra resources to the critical path tasks. This technique is called:","A. Fast Tracking","B. Crashing","C. Resource Leveling","D. Scope Creep","B","Solution: B. Crashing creates a trade-off where you add resources (cost) to decrease duration. Fast Tracking involves doing tasks in parallel."
"Planning","Develop Schedule","Which resource optimization technique adjusts the schedule to manage resource limits but does NOT change the Critical Path?","A. Resource Leveling","B. Resource Smoothing","C. Crashing","D. Fast Tracking","B","Solution: B. Resource Smoothing adjusts the activities within their free and total float. It does not delay the project completion date (Critical Path), whereas Resource Leveling often extends the schedule."

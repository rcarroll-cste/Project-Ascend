# Project Documents - Data Schema

## 1. Entity Definitions (Dictionary)
* **Project Documents**: A collection of 33 distinct documents created and updated throughout the project lifecycle. These are not part of the Project Management Plan.
* **Project Management Plan**: A consolidated plan containing 18 components that defines how the project is executed, monitored, and controlled.
* **Change Request**: A formal proposal to modify any document, deliverable, or baseline. Required to change the Project Management Plan.

## 2. Process Architecture (ITTOs)
* *No specific ITTO process is detailed in this transcript. This is an overview of artifacts.*

## 3. Logic & Constraints (Rules Engine)
* **Constraint:** Project Management Plan Modification -> REQUIRES Change Request.
* **Constraint:** Project Documents -> ARE NOT components of the Project Management Plan.
* **Relationship:** Output of one process (Document) -> OFTEN BECOMES Input to another process.
* **Update Rule:** Project Documents -> Updated consistently throughout the project (do not strictly require formal Change Control unless baselined).

## 4. Analytical Models (Matrices & Formulas)
* **Model Name:** Project Artifacts Classification
* **Structure:**
    *   **Project Management Plan Components:** 18 total items (baselines and subsidiary plans).
    *   **Project Documents:** 33 total items (dynamic documents updated frequently).

## 5. Semantic Associations (Metadata)
* **Project Documents vs. Plan** :: Documents are dynamic and updated often; the Plan is static/baselined and requires formal change control.
* **"Included but not limited to"** :: Phrase indicating that a process can use any relevant project document as an input, even if not explicitly listed in the primary ITTO list.
* **Activity Duration Estimates** :: Example of a document used as input to determine Cost.

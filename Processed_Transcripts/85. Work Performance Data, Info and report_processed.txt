# Work Performance Data, Information, and Reports - Data Schema

## 1. Entity Definitions (Dictionary)
* **Work Performance Data (WPD)**: Raw observations and measurements identified during activities being performed to carry out the project work. It contains no analysis.
* **Work Performance Information (WPI)**: The performance data collected from controlling processes, analyzed in comparison to the Project Management Plan.
* **Work Performance Report (WPR)**: The physical or electronic representation of work performance information compiled in project documents, intended to generate decisions, actions, or awareness.

## 2. Process Architecture (ITTOs)
* *This transcript defines a data flow across Process Groups rather than a single specific process.*

## 3. Logic & Constraints (Rules Engine)
* **Data Flow Rule:** Executing Processes -> Output: Work Performance Data.
* **Information Flow Rule:** Work Performance Data + Project Management Plan -> Monitoring & Controlling Processes -> Output: Work Performance Information.
* **Reporting Flow Rule:** Work Performance Information (Aggregated) -> Output: Work Performance Report.
* **Utility Constraint:** Work Performance Data REQUIRES comparison against the Plan to become useful (Information).
* **Usage Rule:** Work Performance Reports -> Inputs to Change Control Boards and Stakeholder Communications.

## 4. Analytical Models (Matrices & Formulas)
* **Model Name:** Performance Data Transformation Cycle
* **Structure:** Linear progression from Raw Data to Contextualized Analysis to Aggregated Reporting.
* **Formula:** `WPI = WPD + Project Management Plan (Comparison)`
* **Formula:** `WPR = Σ(WPI from Scope, Schedule, Cost, etc.)`

## 5. Semantic Associations (Metadata)
* **Work Performance Data** :: Raw Facts (e.g., "Painted wall white", "Spent $200").
* **Work Performance Information** :: Status Check (e.g., "Off schedule", "Wrong color painted").
* **Work Performance Report** :: Overall Status Document (e.g., "Project Status Report").
* **Monitoring and Controlling** :: Keeping the project on plan.

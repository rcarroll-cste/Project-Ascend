# Project Management Plan - Data Schema

## 1. Entity Definitions (Dictionary)
* **Project Management Plan**: The document that describes how the project will be executed, monitored, and controlled. It consolidates all subsidiary management plans and baselines, and other information necessary to manage the project.
* **Subsidiary Management Plan**: A component of the project management plan that describes how a specific knowledge area or aspect of the project (e.g., cost, schedule, scope) will be planned, executed, and controlled.
* **Baseline**: The approved version of a work product that can only be changed through formal change control procedures and is used as a basis for comparison to actual results.

## 2. Process Architecture (ITTOs)
* *The transcript describes the Project Management Plan itself rather than the specific "Develop Project Management Plan" process ITTOs in detail, focusing on the composition of the plan.*

## 3. Logic & Constraints (Rules Engine)
* **Constraint:** Execution, Monitoring, Control, and Closing actions -> REQUIRE Project Management Plan definitions.
* **Composition Rule:** Project Management Plan CONTAINS 18 Components (14 Subsidiary Plans + 4 Baselines).
* **Usage Rule:** Project Management Plan -> INPUT to almost all 49 processes (defines "how" to do the process).
* **Flexibility Rule:** Project Management Plan Components -> "Included but not limited to" (allows for additional documents/plans as needed).

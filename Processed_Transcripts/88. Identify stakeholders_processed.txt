# Identify Stakeholders - Data Schema

## 1. Entity Definitions (Dictionary)
*   **Identify Stakeholders**: The process of identifying project stakeholders regularly and analyzing and recording relevant information regarding their interests, involvement, interdependencies, influence, and potential impact on project success.
*   **Stakeholder Analysis**: A technique of systematically gathering and analyzing quantitative and qualitative information to determine whose interests should be taken into account throughout the project.
*   **Power/Interest Grid**: A classification model used for stakeholder analysis that groups stakeholders on the basis of their level of authority (power) and their level of concern (interest) regarding the project outcomes.
*   **Stakeholder Cube**: A three-dimensional classification model that combines power, interest, and influence to map stakeholders.
*   **Salience Model**: A classification model that describes classes of stakeholders based on their power (ability to impose their will), urgency (need for immediate attention), and legitimacy (their involvement is appropriate).
*   **Stakeholder Register**: A project document including the identification, assessment, and classification of project stakeholders.
*   **Active Participant**: A stakeholder actively involved in the work (e.g., team member).
*   **Passive Participant**: A stakeholder not doing the work but affected by it (e.g., customer watching the work).

## 3. Logic & Constraints (Rules Engine)

*   **Constraint:** New Project Assignment -> REQUIRES Immediate Stakeholder Identification.

*   **Dependency:** Stakeholder Register -> REQUIRED FOR Collect Requirements.
*   **Dependency:** Stakeholder Register -> REQUIRED FOR Plan Communications Management.

## 4. Analytical Models (Matrices & Formulas)
**Model Name:** Power/Interest Grid
*   **Structure:** 2D Matrix. Axis X = Interest (Low/High). Axis Y = Power (Low/High).
*   **Logic:**
    *   High Power / High Interest -> Manage Closely.
    *   High Power / Low Interest -> Keep Satisfied.
    *   Low Power / High Interest -> Keep Informed.
    *   Low Power / Low Interest -> Monitor.

**Model Name:** Directions of Influence
*   **Structure:** Categorization based on relationship to the Project Manager.
*   **Categories:**
    *   **Upwards:** Senior management (High power/influence).
    *   **Downwards:** Team members/Subordinates.
    *   **Outwards:** External entities (Regulators, Suppliers).
    *   **Sidewards:** Peers/Other Project Managers (Resource competition).

**Model Name:** Salience Model
*   **Structure:** Venn Diagram intersecting three variables.
*   **Variables:**
    *   **Power:** Ability to impose will.
    *   **Urgency:** Need for immediate action.
    *   **Legitimacy:** Appropriateness of involvement.

## 5. Semantic Associations (Metadata)

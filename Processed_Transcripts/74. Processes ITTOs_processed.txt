# Processes ITTOs - Data Schema

## 1. Entity Definitions (Dictionary)
* **Process**: A systematic series of activities directed towards causing an end result such that one or more inputs will be acted upon to create one or more outputs.
* **Input**: Any item, whether internal or external to the project, that is required by a process before that process proceeds.
* **Tool & Technique**: Something used to perform an activity to produce a product or result or facilitate a systematic procedure.
* **Output**: A product, result, or service generated by a process. May be an input to a successor process.
* **Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEF)**: Conditions, not under the immediate control of the team, that influence, constrain, or direct the project, program, or portfolio.
* **Organizational Process Assets (OPA)**: Plans, processes, policies, procedures, and knowledge bases that are specific to and used by the performing organization.
* **Expert Judgment**: Judgment provided based upon expertise in an application area, knowledge area, discipline, industry, etc., as appropriate for the activity being performed.
* **Project Charter**: A document issued by the project initiator or sponsor that formally authorizes the existence of a project and provides the project manager with the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities.
* **Assumption Log**: A project document used to record all assumptions and constraints throughout the project life cycle.

* **Constraint:** Process Execution -> PRODUCES Outputs.
* **Rule:** Tools & Techniques -> Always grouped together in process definitions.
* **Rule:** Common Inputs -> Many processes share EEFs and OPAs as inputs.
* **Rule:** Common Tools -> Many processes utilize Expert Judgment and Meetings.

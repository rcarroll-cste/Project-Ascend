# Introduction to Traditional Project Management - Data Schema

## 1. Entity Definitions (Dictionary)
* **Traditional Project Management**: A project management methodology characterized by well-defined scope, clear standards, and minimal expected changes. Also known as Waterfall or Predictive.
* **Predictive Project Management**: A synonym for Traditional Project Management, emphasizing the ability to predict execution, monitoring, and control based on previous experience and known scope.
* **Waterfall Methodology**: A linear approach to project management (common in software development history) where phases flow downwards; synonymous with Traditional Project Management.
* **Scope Creep**: Uncontrolled expansion of product or project scope without adjustments to time, cost, and resources.
* **Scope (Traditional)**: The work that needs to be accomplished; must be well-defined and clear at the very beginning of the project.

## 2. Process Architecture (ITTOs)
* *Note: This source serves as a high-level introduction and does not detail specific ITTOs for a single process.*

## 3. Logic & Constraints (Rules Engine)
* **Constraint**: Traditional Project -> Requires Scope to be known and defined upfront.
* **Constraint**: Traditional Project -> Requires Standards/Processes to be clear and proven.
* **Constraint**: Traditional Project -> Changes are NOT expected during execution.
* **Constraint**: Major Scope Change (Traditional) -> Requires Demolition/Restart (High Impact/Cost).
* **Sequence Rule**: Define Scope -> Precedes Foundation/Execution.
* **Planning Rule**: Planning (Traditional) -> Performed Upfront (prior to execution).
* **Control Rule**: Project Manager -> Retains control (in contrast to Agile where the Team is in control).
* **Performance Objective**: Traditional Project -> Adhere strictly to Schedule and Budget (Minimize Variance).

## 4. Analytical Models (Matrices & Formulas)
* *No specific analytical models or formulas were defined in this transcript.*

## 5. Semantic Associations (Metadata)
* **Predictive Project** :: Gym Exercise (You predict how to do it because you've done it before).
* **Traditional Project** :: Construction/20 Story Building (Cannot change height after foundation is laid).
* **Agile Project** :: Software Development (Scope evolves, conceptual start, iterative additions).
* **Scope Creep** :: Monster (Grows out of control).

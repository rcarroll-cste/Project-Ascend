# Data Gathering, Analysis, Representation, and Decision Making - Data Schema

## 1. Entity Definitions (Dictionary)
* **Data Gathering**: The technique of acquiring information regarding the current and previous state of the project from various sources.
* **Brainstorming**: A data gathering technique where a group of stakeholders is brought together to generate and analyze ideas, typically facilitated by the Project Manager.
* **Interviews**: A formal or informal approach to elicit information from stakeholders by talking to them directly (often used for requirements gathering).
* **Focus Groups**: Bringing together prequalified stakeholders and subject matter experts to learn about their expectations and attitudes about a proposed product, service, or result.
* **Checklists**: A structured tool, often created by the organization, used to verify that a set of required steps has been performed or to identify specific requirements/features.
* **Questionnaires and Surveys**: Written sets of questions designed to quickly accumulate information from a large number of respondents.
* **Data Analysis**: The process of examining gathered data to identify trends, variances, or underlying causes.
* **Alternatives Analysis**: A technique used to evaluate identified options in order to select which options or approaches to use to execute and perform the work of the project.
* **Root Cause Analysis**: An analytical technique used to determine the basic underlying reason that causes a variance, defect, or risk.
* **Variance Analysis**: A method for determining the cause and degree of difference between the baseline and actual performance.
* **Trend Analysis**: An analytical technique that uses mathematical models to forecast future outcomes based on historical results; looks at data over a period of time.
* **Data Representation**: The method of presenting analyzed data in charts, graphs, or matrices to facilitate understanding and decision making.
* **Decision Making**: The process of choosing a course of action from multiple alternatives based on the analyzed data.
* **Voting**: A collective decision-making technique (e.g., Unanimity, Majority, Plurality).
* **Autocratic Decision Making**: A decision-making technique in which one individual takes responsibility for making the decision for the group.
* **Multicriteria Decision Analysis**: A technique that utilizes a decision matrix to provide a systematic analytical approach for establishing criteria, such as risk levels, uncertainty, and valuation, to evaluate and rank many ideas.

## 2. Process Architecture (ITTOs)
* *Note: This transcript describes General Tools & Techniques used across multiple processes, rather than a single specific process.*

## 3. Logic & Constraints (Rules Engine)
* **Data Flow Sequence**: Data Gathering -> Data Analysis -> Data Representation -> Decision Making.
* **Requirements Constraint**: Inaccurate Requirements -> Increases Probability of Project Failure.
* **Trend Logic**: IF Variance is consistent or increasing over time -> THEN Trend is forming (Positive or Negative).

## 4. Analytical Models (Matrices & Formulas)
* **Model Name:** Variance vs. Trend
* **Structure:**
    *   **Variance**: Snapshot of a specific point in time (Difference between Plan and Actual).
    *   **Trend**: Series of variances plotted over time to show directionality.

* **Model Name:** Multicriteria Decision Analysis Matrix
* **Structure:** Table/Grid.
    *   **Rows**: Candidates/Options (e.g., different painters).
    *   **Columns**: Criteria (e.g., Cost, Experience, Certification, Availability).
    *   **Values**: Weighted scores or ratings for each criterion.
*   **Formula**: `Total Score = Sum(Criteria Weight * Rating)` (Implicit in description).
